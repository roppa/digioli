    "md": "<p>Blatant copy of the default Ghost article :-)</p>\n<p>If you've gotten pretty comfortable with <a href=\"/the-editor/\">all the basics</a> of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>\n<h2 id=\"specialformatting\">Special formatting</h2>\n<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><s>strike through</s></li>\n<li><mark>highlight</mark></li>\n<li>*escaped characters*</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"writingcodeblocks\">Writing code blocks</h2>\n<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>\n<pre><code>.my-link {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href=\"http://prismjs.com/\">Prism.js</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullbleedimages\">Full bleed images</h2>\n<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full\" alt=\"walking\"></p>\n<p>which is styled with...</p>\n<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {\n    max-width: 100vw;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"referencelists\">Reference lists</h2>\n<p><strong>The quick brown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox\" title=\"Wikipedia: Fox\">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Wikipedia: Dog\">dog</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingfootnotes\">Creating footnotes</h2>\n<p>The quick brown fox<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullhtml\">Full HTML</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Foxes are red <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Dogs are usually not red <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n"

    "md": "<p>Yeah that. Well sometimes you can set a variable to refer to &quot;this&quot; as &quot;that&quot;, but &quot;that&quot; is another story.</p>\n<p>When I was a Java programmer, it was easy to understand what &quot;this&quot; was. It was &quot;this&quot;, a built in reference to the thing instantiated. Simple. Getting up to scratch with Javascript means understanding the finer details of the language (as well as the many quirks). What the &quot;this&quot; keyword (or the parameter &quot;this&quot;) is bound to is one of those things.</p>\n<p>There are five main things which &quot;this&quot; is bound to at <strong>call time</strong> (this call time point is important).</p>\n<p>In Javascript, functions are &quot;first class citizens&quot; - objects that can be stored and passed as parameters (also referred to as Lambda). So we might think that if we use &quot;this&quot; in a function, &quot;this&quot; will refer to the current function, being as it is really an object. Well, think again. Just to confuse things, functions can be used as constructors that are used to create classes using the &quot;new&quot; keyword.</p>\n<h2 id=\"constructorfunctions\">Constructor functions</h2>\n<p>Coming from a Java background it is pretty straight forward to know what &quot;this&quot; refers to when defining a class. When you create a new instance of the class &quot;this&quot; is bound to the object that was created. Similarly in Javascript.</p>\n<pre><code>var Car = function (make, model) {\n  this.make = make;\n  this.model = model;\n};\n\nCar.prototype.getMake = function () {\n  return this.make;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Only when a new object is created will &quot;this&quot; be bound to it. We do this using the &quot;new&quot; operator:</p>\n<pre><code>var myCar = new Car(&quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;Mustang&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the constructor, as it is now, we wouldn't know what &quot;this&quot; would be bound to because it hasn't been instantiated. We only know what &quot;this&quot; means because of the &quot;.&quot; notation. Anything to the left of the dot will be &quot;this&quot;.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I think it is good to know exactly what is happening behind the scenes of a constructor function. Behind the scenes an object is created somewhat like the below:</p>\n<pre><code>var Car = function (make, model) {\n  //var this = Object.create({});\n  this.make = make;\n  this.model = model;\n  //return this;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The parameter in &quot;Object.create({})&quot; in this instance is just an object. If there was a prototype object defined that would be used as the parameter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodscope\">Method scope</h2>\n<p>Similar to constructor, say we have an object literal with a method &quot;getName&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code>var man = {\n   name: &quot;Bob&quot;,\n   getName: function () {\n      return this.name;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you call <code>man.getName()</code> we can see that getName is a method on &quot;man&quot;, so that will be the object that &quot;this&quot; is bound to. Just like before, JavaScript will come across the &quot;this&quot; keyword and work up the call stack. In this case it will see that to the left of the dot is the &quot;man&quot; object, so that would be bound to &quot;this&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"globalscope\">Global scope</h2>\n<p>So in JavaScript we can see that &quot;this&quot; needs to be bound to something. Assuming we run this in a Chrome console:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log(this);\n</code></pre>\n<p>&quot;window : { ... &quot; will be be returned if you are in a browser, or a whole lot of other code if you are running it in Node. The JavaScript engine will, as before, work up the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2sFmqvpBe0\">call stack</a> looking for what is bound to &quot;this&quot;, but in this case there are no created objects so it will default to the global object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functionscope\">Function scope</h2>\n<p>Function expression and function declaration work in a similar way as &quot;global&quot; when it comes to &quot;this&quot;. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>var test = function () {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>function test () {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both of these will log whatever the global environment is. Even if these functions are declared within an object. That is a tricky one. It gets tricky when we consider something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>var topObject = {\n doSomething : function () {\n  var doSubSomething = function () {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n  doSubSomething();\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Calling <code>topObject.doSomething();</code> would log the global environment, not the context it is called in. This is because it is not a method, it is a function expression.</p>\n<h2 id=\"callandapplyparameterboundscope\">Call and Apply, parameter bound scope</h2>\n<p>So in these cases, the object you pass as the first parameter will be referenced to &quot;this&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code>var man = {\n   name: &quot;Bob&quot;,\n   getName: function () {\n      return this.name;\n   }\n};\n\nvar man2 = {\n\tname : &quot;Smithy&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Calling <code>man.getName.call(man2)</code> would log &quot;Smithy&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bind\">Bind</h2>\n<p>I said earlier there were 5 <strong>main</strong> ways that &quot;this&quot; is used. Bind kind of fits in with understanding &quot;this&quot;. The function bind creates a new function with the context set to that which was passed in. &quot;this&quot; will refer to that context.</p>\n<p>Now that's that.</p>\n"

If you're using a region other than US East (you can check that in the elastic bamboo configuration), there will be no stock AMIs available for you, you're dealing with a custom AMI and that will need a lot of configuration. Stock AMIs will be available in all regions within a couple of weeks (from January 2015).</p>\n<p>Once Bamboo is set up and we have an Elastic Instance then we can add a build.

Like most things, the key is in the name. A shell of anything covers the thing inside. A shell then is a program that receives and interprets commands from &quot;outside&quot; and interfaces with the inner workings of that which is &quot;inside&quot; i.e. the inner workings of the operating system. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0\">Watch this</a>.</p>\n<p>By default your terminal runs a shell called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)\">bash</a>. There are flavours of such programs and you can easily <a href=\"http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/21/change-shell-mac-os-x/\">change shells</a>. You can see what your shell is by running:</p>\n<pre><code>env\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>env</code> command lets you look at your environment so it displays a lot of information. For example, I have &quot;<a href=\"http://ohmyz.sh/\">oh my zsh</a>&quot; and use <a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>...\nLANG=en_GB.UTF-8\nPWD=/\nSHELL=/bin/zsh\nTERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"help\">Help</h2>\n<p>If you get stuck with a command, help is always at hand. You can type <code>man [command]</code> - to access the manual page. To display all the commands available in the shell:</p>\n<pre><code>man source\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use <code>apropos</code> to find what man page is appropriate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cutsomisation\">Cutsomisation</h2>\n<p>You can customise your shell by adding commands, aliases etc into a file, depending on your environment. Sometimes it is a <code>.bashrc</code> file in your home directory. Or, if you use zshell then that is the <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directories\">Directories</h2>\n<p>To find out where I am I use <code>pwd</code> which stands for &quot;print working directory&quot;. Once you know where you are you can see the contents of the directory using <code>ls</code> and use flags such as <code>-l</code> or <code>-la</code>. <code>cd ../../somewhere</code> changes directory.</p>\n<p>Creating a directory:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir test\n</code></pre>\n<p>Creating and moving to that directory:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir test &amp;&amp; cd test\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note, the &amp;&amp; can be used with any command that follows each other, such as <code>cd</code> and then <code>ls</code>.</p>\n<p>Creating a nested folder structure:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir test test/sub1 test/sub1/subsub1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the <code>-p</code> flag:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir -p /parent/child/test\n</code></pre>\n<p>A really handy way to create a multiple nested folder structure:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir -p parent/{child1, child2, child3}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This makes documents, with 3 sub folders for years, each having 4 seasons:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir -p /documents/{2011,2012,2013}/{Winter,Spring,Summer,Fall}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"symlinks\">Symlinks</h2>\n<p>&quot;Symlinks&quot; (symbolic or soft links) are so powerful and useful. If you want to group folders in one location, but you don't want to move them from where they already exists, symlinks are for you. You create a symlink by using the -s flag:</p>\n<pre><code>ln -s /path/to/existing/file mycurrentfolder\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"files\">Files</h2>\n<p>Using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_%28Unix%29\">touch</a> to create an html file:</p>\n<pre><code>touch index.html\n</code></pre>\n<p>Creating multiple files at once</p>\n<pre><code>touch index.htm style.css main.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've seen TJ Hollowaychuk use something like this (though I can't get it working myself!):</p>\n<pre><code>touch !!:2/{file.ext,file.ext}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>echo</code> command prints arguments passed, but we can use those arguments for creating a file and writing to a file:</p>\n<pre><code>echo &quot;Your copy&quot; &gt; targetfile.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to view the contents of a file use <code>less</code> to paginate through the file or use <code>cat</code> to print out the whole file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removingstuff\">Removing stuff</h2>\n<p>Remove multiple files having the same name:</p>\n<pre><code>rm lib/*/filename.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>Delete all files and folders under a folder:</p>\n<pre><code>rm -rf /var/www/idiots-guide/content/*\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"renamingstuff\">Renaming stuff</h2>\n<p>Mac terminal batch rename file. Just to make sure things don't go tits up, do an echo first:</p>\n<pre><code>for filename in *.png; do echo mv &quot;$filename&quot; &quot;${filename//_cyan/}&quot;; done\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then do the real thing if all is ok:</p>\n<pre><code>for filename in *.png; do mv &quot;$filename&quot; &quot;${filename//_cyan/}&quot;; done\n</code></pre>\n<p>Mac terminal batch lowercase files:</p>\n<pre><code>for i in *; do mv &quot;$i&quot; &quot;$(echo $i|tr A-Z a-z)&quot;; done\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"duplicating\">Duplicating</h2>\n<p>The <code>ditto</code> command copies source files and structure into destination:</p>\n<pre><code>ditto folder1 folder2\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"compressfilesusingzip\">Compress files using Zip</h2>\n<pre><code>zip -r data.zip /data\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"unzip\">Unzip</h2>\n<pre><code>unzip data.zip -d /data\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"usingtar\">Using Tar</h2>\n<p>The <code>tar</code> &quot;tape archive&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code>tar czf target.tar.gz foldertocompress\n</code></pre>\n<p>and to extract:</p>\n<pre><code>tar xzf target.tar.gz -C target\n</code></pre>\n<p>a variation:</p>\n<pre><code>tar zxvf target.tar.gz -C /my/folder/\n</code></pre>\n<p>-z runs the file through gzip<br>\n-x extract the file<br>\n-v verbose output<br>\n-f specifies the file name to decompress</p>\n<h2 id=\"fileandfolderinformation\">File and folder information</h2>\n<p>To display the sizes of folders in a directory</p>\n<pre><code>du -sh */\n</code></pre>\n<p>Find the top ten largest files:</p>\n<pre><code>du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -10\n</code></pre>\n<p>Determining how much disk space you are using:</p>\n<pre><code>df\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>df -h\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above also shows mounted drives.

Not really an article that is a deal breaker for a technical interview, more like a &quot;note to self&quot; type of thing. Anyhoo, voila.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arraypush\">Array.push</h2>\n<p>When you push something to an array, the return value is the new length of the array. I used push all the time but never used considered the return value. Note to self.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arrayconcat\">Array.concat</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat\">Concat</a> is really handy. I try to keep in mind that multiple arrays can be concatenated:</p>\n<pre><code>var nums = [1,2,3].concat([4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]);\n//nums will be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"arrayshiftandarrayunshift\">Array.shift and Array.unshift</h2>\n<p>Two great functions. With these two you can implement a queue data structure.</p>\n<pre><code>const queue = [];\nqueue.unshift(1);\nqueue.unshift(2);\nqueue.unshift(3);\n// [3, 2, 1]\nqueue.shift(); //3\nqueue.shift(); //2\nqueue.shift(); //1\n// []\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"arrayslice\">Array.slice</h2>\n<p>Not to be confused with splice. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice\">Slice</a> returns a slice of the target array.</p>\n<pre><code>[1,2,3,4].slice(1,2);\n//[2, 3]\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"arraysome\">Array.some</h2>\n<p>Handy to check if some of your array elements are truthy. You can also !Array.some to find out if none are &quot;truthy&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arraysplice\">Array.splice</h2>\n<p>I used to use splice to just delete elements from an array (that function and its name didn't make much sense to me before). However it is much more useful and more to it than just deleting elements.</p>\n<p>The splice function modifies the array it is being used on. If any elements have been deleted they are returned, if nothing has been removed it returns an empty array.</p>\n<p>Say we want a list like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 but we have a list like this:</p>\n<pre><code>var test = [1,2,4,4,5,8]\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, lets add the number 3 to the third element of the array. As we know, arrays are zero indexed, so we want to put 3 into the third element, which would have the index of 2.</p>\n<p>The second parameter is how many elements we want to remove, or rather, the number of elements to skip over before we &quot;splice&quot; the remaining section. In this case we do not want to remove any so we specify 0.</p>\n<p>Then we pass in the item/s we want to be inserted, in this case 3. Now we have <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8]</code> which is looking much better.</p>\n<pre><code>test.splice(2,0,3);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have 4 appearing twice, so we need to remove one. Let's remove the first. To do this we pass in the index to delete from, so starting at 0 it will be 3. Then we pass how many we want to delete, which is 1. The rest of the array is &quot;spliced&quot; to the first part, so in essence it deletes 1 element.</p>\n<pre><code>test.splice(3,1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would return <code>[4]</code> and test would be <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]</code>.</p>\n<p>Next we need to fill the gap between 5 and 8, so we need to insert 6 and 7. We can do that in one go by specifying the index to start at, how many to delete/skip over, and then the new values to insert:</p>\n<pre><code>test.splice(5,0,6,7);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, an empty array is returned as nothing has been deleted, and test is now <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arraysort\">Array.sort</h2>\n<p>There is more to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort\">Array.sort</a> than meets the eye.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p>More information at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice\">MDN</a></p>\n"

A total paradigm shift from other languages like Java and PHP.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to &quot;create objects&quot;, some are more economical and efficient than others, while some seem very complex.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functional\">Functional</h2>\n<p>We can set up a function that acts like a constructor function, but without having to use the &quot;new&quot; keyword. The function creates objects, applies a prototype, initialises, and then return the objects. This is basically a factory method. The constructor conventions are the same in that we capitalise the function.</p>\n<pre><code>var Vehicle = function () {\n  var vehicleInstance = Object.create();\n  vehicleInstance.make = &quot;Unknown&quot;;\n  vehicleInstance.getMake () {\n     return this.make;\n  }\n  return vehicleInstance;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The immediate thing that is not great about this method is that each method is created anew in each instance.</p>\n<p>This leads us to sharing these methods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functionalshared\">Functional Shared</h2>\n<p>In order to get around recreating methods for each new object, we can add methods as references using an extend function.</p>\n<pre><code>var Vehicle = function () {\n  var vehicleInstance = {};\n  extend(vehicleInstance, vehiclePrototype);\n  vehicleInstance.make = &quot;Unknown&quot;;\n  return vehicleInstance;\n}\n\nfunction extend (obj1, obj2) {\n  var key;\n  for (key in obj2) {\n    obj1[key] = obj2[key];\n  }\n}\n\nvar vehiclePrototype = {\n  function : getMake () {\n     return this.make;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think it looks a little messy though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prototypal\">Prototypal</h2>\n<p>This is one step closer to classical inheritance. In this method we are making use of Object.create to create a new object and add its intended prototype as a parameter.</p>\n<pre><code>var Vehicle = function () {\n  var vehicleInstance = Object.create(vehiclePrototype);\n  vehicleInstance.make = &quot;Unknown&quot;;\n  return vehicleInstance;\n}\n\nvar vehiclePrototype = {\n  function : getMake () {\n     return this.make;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"pseudoclassical\">Pseudo classical</h2>\n<p>JavaScript is a prototypal language, meaning that objects inherit from other objects, and not classes. The difference between a constructor function and a &quot;usual&quot; function, is how the function used. To use a function as a constructor function you would use the &quot;new&quot; keyword. An object is returned, with its prototype set to the function object, and the constructor property on the prototype is set to the function. Sounds complex! It is! However, using this pattern is great as it promotes economical code use and doesn't clutter the namespace.</p>\n<pre><code>var Vehicle = function () {\n  this.make = &quot;Unknown&quot;;\n}\n\nVehicle.prototype.getMake = function () {\n  return this.make;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>I had an interview recently and the lead developer asked me if I preferred &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;prototypal&quot; inheritance in JavaScript. I was like &quot;huh?&quot; Turns out he thought the es6 class is something different to prototypal inheritance. Classes are syntactic sugar around prototypal inheritance (check it out at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\">Mozilla</a>). Needless to say I declined that position.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ryanatkinson.io/javascript-instantiation-patterns/\">Amazing resource on JavaScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#constructorpatternjavascript\">Addy Osmani essential js design patterns</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>All tied up with Bind? I know the feeling - fifty shades of it.</p>\n<p>It took me a while to understand what is going on with Bind. Reading the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind\">documentation</a> a few times still left me wondering what was going on.</p>\n<pre><code>The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has it's this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is quite a mouthful, and there is a lot going on with it. Bind permanently binds a context (&quot;this&quot; value) to a function. In essence Bind returns a duplicate of the target function with the context (&quot;this&quot;) bound to it. Any references to &quot;this&quot; in the function will reference the context passed in.</p>\n<p>To get a clearer idea of how it works lets rewrite the Bind function.</p>\n<p>As before <code>The bind() method creates a new function ...</code> means that the bind function just returns a function:</p>\n<pre><code>Function.prototype.bind = function () {\n  return function () {\n\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Great, the basic structure is there - the function object now has a bind function, that returns a new function. Now lets set up the context. The purpose of bind is to permanently attach the context param (or the &quot;this&quot; parameter) to the function that bind is called on.</p>\n<p>Now, as bind is called on a function like <code>myFunction.bind(...</code> we need to keep a reference to <code>myFunction</code>. Once we have the reference to the original function, we need to call it and pass the specified context to run it on, as well as any parameters that are passed.</p>\n<pre><code>Function.prototype.bind = function (context) {\n  var fn = this; //original bound function\n  return function () {\n    //get the arguments of the called bound function\n    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n    //call the function (using &quot;apply&quot; in this case)\n    return fn.apply(context, args);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To recap what just happend, we start by creating a closure with a reference to the function being bound by using <code>var fn = this;</code>. At the moment &quot;this&quot; means nothing. &quot;this&quot; will refer to the function being bound to the left of the dot (.) when bind is called. <code>return fn.apply(context, arguments);</code> is the magic line that calls the bound function with the context parameter &quot;this&quot;.</p>\n<p>Hopefully we have a clearer idea of what is going on now. But why use it? Bound, what is you good for?</p>\n<p>Because we can change the context of &quot;this&quot;, we could capitalise on code reuse by using methods as stand alone functions.</p>\n<p>Bind is also great for when we want to use a setTimeout without using an IIFE.</p>\n<p>An example of both of the above in one:</p>\n<pre><code>var someObject = {\n  someAttribute: &quot;Message&quot;,\n  someFunction: function () {\n    console.log(this.someAttribute);\n  }\n};\n\nsetTimeout(someObject.someFunction.bind(someObject), 1000);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is a great article on <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/23/understanding-javascript-function-prototype-bind/\">understanding function prototype bind</a>.</p>\n<p>Oh, as an aside, you may have heard the term 'Curry' or 'Currying' too. Basically it is the same as the bind function. You can gain partial application by passing parameters after the target 'this'. For example</p>\n<pre><code>function a (x, y, z) {\n  console.log(x, y, z);\n}\n\na(1,2,3) // 1 2 3\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>b = a.bind(null, 1, 2)\n\nb(3) // 1 2 3\n</code></pre>\n<p>Happy binding!</p>\n"

    "md": "<p>Oh. Big oh. Or rather Big-O. I thought &quot;O&quot; stood for &quot;operations&quot;. And &quot;big&quot; because of magnitude. Man I was way off:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the family of Bachmann-Landau notations, the one most relevant to algorithms was the one with the Omicron symbol. That symbol can be best described textually or verbally as a 'big O'. Operations correspond to time. It takes time to do something. Algorithms are a series of steps to accomplish something. <cite url=\"http://www.quora.com/What-does-the-O-in-Big-O-notation-refer-to\">Quora</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"complexitytheory\">Complexity theory</h2>\n<p>Complexity theory is the study of how complicated algorithms are. An algorithm should have these three attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An algorithm should be correct.</li>\n<li>An algorithm should be easy to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>It should be efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two sides to this last point however. One is storage <strong>space</strong>. An algorithm is not useful if we run out of memory while it is running. The other side is that an algorithm should be efficient with regards to <strong>time</strong>. Sometimes there is a compromise between storage space and the time for operations to run.</p>\n<p>Sometimes time is not of great benefit. For example password search when logging in doesn't need to be lightning fast. If someone were set up a way to guess someones account we don't want to make it fast for them.</p>\n<p>This point about <strong>time</strong> is where complexity theory comes in, forming the basis for Big O notation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><q cite=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/article/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity\">Big O notation is the language we use for articulating how long an algorithm takes to run. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem. With big O notation we express the runtime in terms of—brace yourself—how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large.<br>\nAn array is indexed, so we can access any element in one operation. So the answer is 1.</q><br>\n<cite>Interviewcake.com</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Definition</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Asymptotic</strong><br>\nA line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Asymptotic means how the runtime grows relative to the input.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/big-o-complexity.png\" alt=\"Big O complexity\"></p>\n<p>Data structures are a set of tools (comprised of both structures and algorithms) for a software engineer. They need to understand the task at hand and use the best tool for the job. Understanding all of these tools and their asymptotic behaviour is an essential part of software engineering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notations\">Notations</h2>\n<p>Big O notation looks the worst case scenario of an algorithm. This is the safest way to look at it, considering it's asymptotic behaviour.</p>\n<h3 id=\"on\">O(n)</h3>\n<p>If an algorithm performs n steps linearly, then the function is O(n). Looping through an array, or getting all of the nodes of a tree structure is of the order n.</p>\n<h3 id=\"o2n\">O(2n)</h3>\n<p>If an algorithm performs n steps linearly, then another n steps linearly, then the function is O(2n). One example is finding the smallest and largest number in an array.</p>\n<pre><code>function findMax (array) {\n  var i;\n  var max = 0;\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {\n    if (array[i] &gt; max) {\n      array[i] = max;\n    }\n  }\n  return max;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to find the largest value we have to process the array linearly. The array length could be any size, so the order is of n.</p>\n<h3 id=\"o1\">O(1)</h3>\n<p>Some algorithms are the same in every case. Accessing a specific element of an array for example, the operation time will always be 1, O(1).</p>\n<pre><code>function arrayContains (array, target) {\n  return array.indexOf(target) !== -1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is only one operation therefore the order is of 1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"onsup2sup\">O(n<sup>2</sup>)</h3>\n<p>n<sup>2</sup>, or n * n, means that for each n you have to go through n again. For example, a for loop within a for loop.</p>\n<pre><code>function findDuplicates(array) {\n  var i;\n  var j;\n  var duplicates = false;\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j &lt; array.length; i++) {\n      if (i !== j &amp;&amp; array[i] === array[j]) {\n        duplicates = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we are looping through an array, and then looping through it again for each element in the array. Therefor the order is of n<sup>2</sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"ologn\">O(log(n))</h3>\n<p>I've written a separate article on <a href=\"/2015/07/17/logarithms-and-big-o-notation/\">logarithms and Big O notation</a> which explains this in more details.</p>\n<p>In essence it is the number of steps taken to get to a final point. Depending on the base, 2 in binary, 10 in decimal etc, the logarithm is the number of operations to take to get to the target value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"onfactorial\">O(n!) - Factorial</h3>\n<p>This little chestnut below is a factorial:</p>\n<pre><code>var factorial = function(num){\n  if (num &lt; 0){\n    return;\n  }\n  if (num === 0 || num === 1){\n    return 1; \n  } else {\n    return num * factorial(num-1);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The factorial function is useful in computing the number of combinations or permutations that can be constructed from a set of objects. <cite url=\"http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57588.html\">Dr. Math</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Factorials are useful when calculating the number of possibilites/permutations of a given number of items.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constants\">Constants</h3>\n<p>If an algorithm has two functions, where one performs n steps or n<sup>2</sup>, and the other function performs less or a fixed set of steps, then the second function can be ignored and the notation would be the greatest of the two. It is basically rounding up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/algo\">Free course on data structures and complexity theory</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-explanation-of-big-o\">Plain english explanation of Big O</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/article/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity\">Great article on interviewcake.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bigocheatsheet.com/\">Big-o notation cheatsheet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/4874OS_Appendix_Big_O_Cheat_Sheet.pdf\">Big-o pdf</a></p>\n"

So we can see there are a lot of relationship lines all over the shop - a bit like the royal family.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, lets take a look at how pseudo classical inheritance works.

Here is what is going on.</p>\n<p>The Bird constructor function calls the Egg constructor using <code>Egg.call(this);</code> which adds properties from Egg to Bird, as we have passed the parameter &quot;this&quot; to be bound to &quot;Bird&quot;.</p>\n<p>Now the constructor will be referencing Egg as we have just inherited the prototype from &quot;Egg&quot;. Because of this we need to fix the correct constructor reference by <code>Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;</code></p>\n<p>Make sense?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/roppa/e5hs3tva/\">Have a fiddle</a></p>\n<p>Just as an aside, it is interesting to know that you can create a function using new, and the last argument is the function body:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; new Function('test', 'return console.log(test)')('Hi there');\n&gt; Hi there\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/\">Ecma 5.1</a></p>\n"

    "md": "<p>My mathematical education was somewhat lacking as at school I was put in the &quot;divvy&quot; classes - classes for the &quot;not too bright&quot; or &quot;remedial&quot;. So coming across terms like &quot;logarithm&quot; is a little unsettling. I'm assuming that some people reading this may not be familiar with the term either, so I will endeavour to understand it myself and explain it. So what is a logarithm?</p>\n<p>Doing a search on the Googles for &quot;what is a logarithm&quot; it comes up with  this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(As an aside, the derivation of &quot;logarithm&quot; is from the Greek 'logos', meaning 'reckoning, ratio', and 'arithmos' meaning 'number').</p>\n<p>That is a pretty meaty sentence so I had to do some more searching. I would recommend going to Khan academy and <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/logarithms-tutorial/logarithm_basics/v/logarithms\">watching this cool video on Logarithms</a>. To put that grounding into use I started applying it with binary trees. I think they are a good example to start with, as binary has only two options, making you choose one (true or false?). So you can either visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_logarithm\">binary algorithms on wikipedia</a> or not! I used <a href=\"http://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/Log_Calculator.htm\">this log calculator</a> too as it is pretty simple, reminds me of Richard Feynman (I love Richard Feynman) here my girlfriend is rolling her eyes.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, just to set the foundation, the logarithm of 4 with a base of 2 is 2. The base is 2 in this instance as we are using a binary tree. So we would write it like Log<sub>2</sub>(4) = 2. A point to note about this, is that Log<sub>2</sub>(4) = 2 is the same as 2<sup>2</sup> = 4. So using a binary tree this means it will take a maximum of 2 steps to get to the deepest node (starting with 1, obviously).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/binary-tree-2-deep.png\" alt=\"Binary tree log 2 of 8\"></p>\n<p>It looks like we only need to include only one of the deepest nodes in our calculation. That makes sense because adding more nodes at the same depth will have no bearing on the number of operations.</p>\n<p>The logarithm of 8 is 3. Log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3 is the same as 2<sup>3</sup> = 8. You should notice that it takes a maximum of 3 operations to access the deepest node.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/binary-tree.png\" alt=\"Binary tree log 2 of 8\"></p>\n<p>The logarithm of 16 is 4. Log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4 is the same as 2<sup>4</sup> = 16. And so on. (the numbers below are random)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/binary-tree-4-deep.png\" alt=\"Binary tree log 2 of 8\"></p>\n<p>Another way to look at it is that the log of n correlates to the depth of the tree. I've come to realise that Mathematics is about seeing patterns in things.</p>\n<p>Algorithms that use O(log n) are extremely fast because adding more and more branches only increases the number of operations by log 2 of n. This is like the classic example of searching for a name in a telephone book.</p>\n<p>Another good description of O(log n) I came across, is on stack overflow called <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307283/what-does-olog-n-mean-exactly\">What does O(log n) mean exactly?</a>.</p>\n<p>This is all simple stuff once it clicks or is explained well.</p>\n"

That would be nice. It is the same thing in JavaScript. We don't want to take care of everything that happens in one function. That leads to a sticky mess. Instead we wan't to use delegation. Yep, exactly like management - lets pass it on to someone else to do. Let's try an example with our car (yeah, original idea right?).</p>\n<pre><code>var car = {\n  engineBroke : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;Oh no! Engine broke&quot;);\n  },\n  dirty : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;I need a valet!&quot;);\n  },\n  mot : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;MOT due!&quot;);\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Great, we have a car. Lets say something shitty happens like a bust engine, or the MOT is due. We really don't have time for that shizzle, so lets take care of it using a decorator function to handle events. What the decorator should do is extend the target object to enable the attachment events, and then trigger those events whenever the right circumstance calls for it.</p>\n<pre><code>var eventSystem = function (target) {\n  target.events = {};\n  target.on = function (verb, cb) {\n    target.events[verb] = target.events[verb] || [];\n    target.events[verb].push(cb);\n  }\n  target.trigger = function (e) {\n    var i;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; target.events[e].length; i++) {\n      target.events[e][i]();\n    }\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now call the decorator function with the object we want to extend.</p>\n<pre><code>eventSystem(car);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So far so good. Now is a good time to explain why we are going about things this way. Two words, &quot;tight coupling&quot;. It sounds nice and romantic, but code is no place for romance. We want a system with high cohesion (things working together in a way that makes sense) along with loose coupling (no hard coded dependancies). A system with tight coupling is really bad practice, just leading to nightmares along the line. High cohesion indicates a well considered approach to solving the problem at hand. Our car might break down, but we may or may not have a mechanic. We cannot add a call to a mechanic to fix the car from our car. We are rich though, so we not only have a mechanic, we have a valet.</p>\n<pre><code>var mechanic = {\n  fixEngine : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;Engine fixed, £500 please!&quot;);\n  },\n  passMot : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;Fixed car so it is legal&quot;);\n  }\n};\n\nvar valet = {\n  cleanCar : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;Shiny new car!&quot;);\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also have a shitty government, so we are not really living in an ideal world:</p>\n<pre><code>var government = {\n  processMot : function () {\n    console.log(&quot;Car verified as legal&quot;);\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats the setup. We have some great staff. Now it is time to set them to work. All we need to do is attach events to the car, and then set the way to handle those events by use of a callback.</p>\n<pre><code>car.on(&quot;engineBroke&quot;, mechanic.fixEngine);\ncar.on(&quot;mot&quot;, mechanic.passMot);\ncar.on(&quot;mot&quot;, government.processMot);\ncar.on(&quot;dirty&quot;, valet.cleanCar);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now any event that is triggered gets handled. Teamwork.</p>\n<pre><code>car.trigger(&quot;engineBroke&quot;);\ncar.trigger(&quot;mot&quot;);\ncar.trigger(&quot;dirty&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/roppa/zhd9m393/\">Have a fiddle</a></p>\n"

    "md": "<p>Testing is essential to development. I've obviously used testing libraries such as Mocha, Chai, Ava, Tape, etc. But how would you go about writing one yourself? Especially how would you build a test framework using that same framework to test itself? I got to thinking, just what would a test runner or 'test harness' consist of? I thought the basics would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It should be able to look for test file/s and execute tests within</li>\n<li>It should be able to make assertions within an executed test</li>\n<li>It should be able to report successes and failures of these assertions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So we would have a command line tool. We would run and record tests and their assertions and record results into a report that is delivered as the conclusion of the tests.</p>\n<p>So I went ahead and created a testing framework called <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/testu\">Testu</a>, and this is what I learned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"harness\">Harness</h2>\n<p>The term harness, or 'test framework', is the thing that keeps track of the tests and sends the result to the reporter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assertions\">Assertions</h2>\n<p>Assertions are statements of facts or beliefs. So they are binary; that an assertion is either correct or wrong. There are many styles of assertions, some prefer a string like method such as <code>expect(value).to.be.ok()</code> or simply <code>assert(condition)</code>.</p>\n<p>General assertions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'assert', 'ok', 'isOk': truthy</li>\n<li>'assertNot', 'not', 'notOk': falsy</li>\n<li>'throws', 'throw': expect an exception to be thrown</li>\n<li>'doesNotThrow', 'notThrow': will not throw an exception</li>\n<li>'equal', 'equals', 'isEqual', 'is', 'strictEqual', 'strictEquals', 'strictIs', 'isStrict', 'isStrictly': equality condition</li>\n<li>'deepEqual', 'deepEquals', 'isDeepEqual', 'isDeep', 'strictDeepEqual', 'strictDeepEquals': object/array equality condition</li>\n<li>'notEqual', 'inequal', 'notEqual', 'notEquals', 'notStrictEqual', 'notStrictEquals', 'isNotEqual', 'isNot', 'doesNotEqual', 'isInequal': object/array not equal</li>\n<li>'notNull', 'isNotNull': specific type assertion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Helper assertions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'isAbove', 'above', 'greaterThan', 'over': numeric value above</li>\n<li>'isBelow', 'below', 'lessThan': numeric value below</li>\n<li>'isAtLeast', 'atLeast', 'greaterThanOrEqual': numeric value less than or equal</li>\n<li>'isFalse': falsy value</li>\n<li>'isTrue': truthy value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Included on the assert function is 'expect', so you can destructure and use the expect format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">test('using expect' ({ expect }) =&gt; {\n  expect(true).to.be.ok();\n  expect(0).to.equal(0);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>'equal': equality test</li>\n<li>'ok': truthy test</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reporter\">Reporter</h2>\n<p>I decided to use <a href=\"https://testanything.org/tap-specification.html\">TAP (test anything protocol)</a> for the default reporter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mocksandstubs\">Mocks and Stubs</h2>\n<p>I haven't included any of these in Testu (yet).

The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks versus a list of password hashes and against pre-computed rainbow table attacks. <cite url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)\">Wikipedia</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Never create your own Hash function, use ones like SHA256, SHA512, RipeMD, and WHIRLPOOL.</p>\n<p>Hash algorithms are one way functions. Data goes in, data comes out.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user creates an account</li>\n<li>Their password is hashed and stored in the database. At no point is the plain text (unencrypted) password ever written to the hard drive</li>\n<li>When the user attempts to login, the hash of the password they entered is checked against the hash of their real password (retrieved from the database)</li>\n<li>If the hashes match, the user is granted access. If not, the user is told they entered invalid login credentials</li>\n<li>Steps 3 and 4 repeat every time someone tries to login to their account</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I always resented messages like 'Either username or password is incorrect'. However, this ambiguity is in place to prevent hackers validating username or password.</p>\n<p>We can randomize the hashes by appending or prepending a random string, called a salt, to the password before hashing. As shown in the example above, this makes the same password hash into a completely different string every time.</p>\n<p>A new random salt must be generated each time a user creates an account or changes their password.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tostoreapassword\">To store a password</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate a long random salt using a CSPRNG.</li>\n<li>Prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a standard cryptographic hash function such as SHA256.</li>\n<li>Save both the salt and the hash in the user's database record.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"tovalidateapassword\">To validate a password</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Retrieve the user's salt and hash from the database</li>\n<li>Prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function</li>\n<li>Compare the hash of the given password with the hash from the database.

I used Homebrew but I know some people suggest against it.</p>\n<p>To get your mongo server (daemon) running, run:</p>\n<pre><code>mongod\n</code></pre>\n<p>To shutdown the service, run:</p>\n<pre><code>db.shutdownServer()\n</code></pre>\n<p>To connect to Mongo, open up a terminal and connect to the db by running:</p>\n<pre><code>mongo\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running <code>mongo --help</code> shows you all the different parameters you can use. For example, using a particular db you can run <code>mongo mydbname</code>. The default port is 27018 so you can change that by <code>mongo --port 7000</code>.</p>\n<p>Now that you are in you may want to know what databases you have, so very similar to a lot of RDMS out there you can run <code>show databases</code> and <code>use database</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>show databases;\nuse chefs;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Mongo has collections for data, so you can run <code>show collections</code>. <code>show tables</code> also works the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insertingarecord\">Inserting a record</h2>\n<p>Having something in the database is a good start.</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.insert({ name: &quot;bob&quot; });\n</code></pre>\n<p>or in version 3.2:</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.insertOne({ name: &quot;bob&quot; });\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"insertingmultiplerecords\">Inserting multiple records</h2>\n<p>The insertMany method allows us to pass in an array of objects to be inserted. It inserts records linearly.</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.insertMany([\n  { name: &quot;bob&quot; },\n  { name: &quot;jim&quot; },\n  { name: &quot;mary&quot; }\n]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>One thing to note about the above is that if any of the objects cause an error, the records after will not be inserted. You can add a second param specifying the order to be false. In this way anything that doesn't cause an error will be inserted.</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.insertMany([\n  { name: &quot;bob&quot; },\n  { name: &quot;jim&quot; },\n  { name: &quot;mary&quot; }\n], { ordered: false });\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"runningqueries\">Running Queries</h2>\n<p>To query collections using <code>find</code>, you can either specify an empty object which will return all records:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find().pretty();\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can specify attributes to search on (multiple attributes act like AND):</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;style&quot;: &quot;sioux&quot; });\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also count the number of records by using <code>count</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find().count(); //returns a number e.g. 8\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also chain commands such as <code>limit</code> to restrict the number of results (the <code>pretty</code> function converts the result into a human readable form):</p>\n<pre><code>db.records.find({ published : true }).limit(5).pretty();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finding records based on some child object attribute is easy too:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;skills.cuisine&quot;: &quot;French&quot; });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Searching in Arrays is also easy. The below would match a user if their restaurant is only Bob's Kitchen:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;restaurants&quot;: [&quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot;] });\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would not match:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;restaurants&quot;: [&quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Kim's Bistro&quot;] });\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this would:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;restaurants&quot;: &quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot; });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another caveat is that using brackets for arrays is an exact comparison. If the document had <code>[&quot;Kim's Bistro&quot;, &quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot;]</code> the query below would not return any results:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;restaurants&quot;: [&quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Kim's Bistro&quot;] });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just like the dot notation on an object, we can also target elements in the array using their index:</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;restaurants.0&quot;: &quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot; });\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"mongo_id\">Mongo _id</h2>\n<p>You'll notice from running any of the above that a <code>_id</code> is created for each record. If you don't specify a <code>_id</code> Mongo will create one for you.</p>\n<p>Mongo stores record primary keys (&quot;_id&quot;) in the BSON format. The primary key type is ObjectId, that is either generated by the application driver or by the <code>mongod</code> service.</p>\n<p>In the event the driver fails to provide a _id field with a unique ObjectId, the mongod service will add it automatically using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch</li>\n<li>A 3-byte machine identifier (MAC Address)</li>\n<li>A 2-byte process ID</li>\n<li>A 3-byte counter, starting with a random value</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cursors\">Cursors</h2>\n<p>The point of a cursor is not to load in all the contents of a query, as in using the toArray function. The cursor sets up the query, waiting for functions to be run against it, such as the forEach function. The forEach looks very much like the forEach in Functional Reactive programming, and it acts very much the same - it streams results.</p>\n<p>Since the Mongo shell is a Javascript interpreter you can use it for things such as cursors. If we don't assign the value returned from <code>find</code> then you get a cursor which iterate through records up to 20 times, triggered by typing &quot;it&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code>let c = db.collection.find();\nc.hasNext(); //true or false\nc.next(); //displays next records\nc.objsLeftInBatch(); //displays number of records left\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"projection\">Projection</h2>\n<p>Projection is just like the real world projection: you can let through only the things that you want. By default, when querying Mongo it returns all fields in results. If you only need certain fields then run the results through a projection, which is specified by the second param of the <code>find</code> method. In this param you specify fields to explicitly include or exclude by passing the attribute and a boolean 1 or 0 whether to include or not.</p>\n<pre><code>db.chefs.find({&quot;restaurants.0&quot;: &quot;Bob's Kitchen&quot; }, {name: 1});\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"queryoperators\">Query Operators</h2>\n<p>There are many query operators: Comparison operators, Element operators, Logical operators, Regex operators, Array operators.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/\">A full list on the docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updatingarecord\">Updating a record</h2>\n<pre><code>db.collection.update( { name: &quot;bob&quot; }, { $set: { &quot;skills.cuisine&quot;: &quot;Spanish&quot; } });\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also update a document using <code>updateOne</code> which updates the first record matching the criteria specified.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upserting\">Upserting</h2>\n<p>&quot;Upserting&quot; is a term meaning a record is inserted if an update attempt is performed on a record that doesn't exist.</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.update( { name: &quot;bob&quot; }, { $set: { &quot;skills.cuisine&quot;: &quot;Spanish&quot; } }, { upsert: true});\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deletingadatabase\">Deleting a database</h2>\n<pre><code>use temp;\ndb.dropDatabase();\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deletingacollection\">Deleting a collection</h2>\n<pre><code>db.collection.drop();\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deletingarecord\">Deleting a record</h2>\n<pre><code>db.collection.remove({ attribute: value }, 1);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deletingallrecords\">Deleting all records</h2>\n<pre><code>db.collection.remove({})\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deletingmultiplerecords\">Deleting multiple records</h2>\n<pre><code>db.collection.remove( { _id : { $in: [\n    ObjectId(&quot;576dbca0f48a891f0048c3ff&quot;), \n    ObjectId(&quot;576dbca0f48a891f0048c401&quot;), \n    ObjectId(&quot;576dbca0f48a891f0048c402&quot;),\n    ObjectId(&quot;576dbca0f48a891f0048c403&quot;),\n    ObjectId(&quot;576dbca0f48a891f0048c404&quot;),\n    ObjectId(&quot;576dbca0f48a891f0048c405&quot;)\n] } } );\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"renamingfields\">Renaming fields</h2>\n<pre><code>db.mycollection.update({}, { $rename: {\n  &quot;nmae&quot;: &quot;name&quot;,\n  &quot;pstcode&quot;: &quot;postcode&quot;\n} }, false, true);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"indexes\">Indexes</h2>\n<p>Searching a non-indexed collection is O(n), so very slow when there are lots of documents. Creating an index means you are sorting that key so a search becomes O(log2n) as it uses a binary search (btree).</p>\n<p>Creating an index is as easy as:</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.createIndex({ myField: 1 });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>1</code> means it is sorted ascending.</p>\n<p>To find out what indexes already exist do:</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.getIndexes();\n</code></pre>\n<p>To delete an index we use <code>dropIndex</code> with the same signature it was created with:</p>\n<pre><code>db.collection.dropIndex({ myField: 1 });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>_id</code> is indexed by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"importingjsonfiles\">Importing JSON files</h2>\n<pre><code>mongoimport -d mydatabasename -c mycollection --drop  --jsonArray --file myJSONFile.json\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"exportingcollections\">Exporting Collections</h2>\n<p>It is easy to export a collection to a JSON file:</p>\n<pre><code>mongoexport --host my.mongo.db.host --port 37017 -d mydatabasename -c mycollection --out /wherever/whatever.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>And to export a CSV file, naming their fields:</p>\n<pre><code>mongoexport --db mydb --collection chefs --type=csv -f &quot;Name&quot;,&quot;Age&quot;,&quot;DOB&quot;,&quot;Cuisine&quot; --out chefs.csv\n</code></pre>\n<p>Flags are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-d</code>: database</li>\n<li><code>-c</code>: collection</li>\n<li><code>-f</code>: field list (to export)</li>\n<li><code>--out</code>:file/directory path and file to export to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exporting is fine when you are using JSON files or importing csv files. But this is not great for backing up or restoring your databases. Instead you want to take a great big dump.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mongodumpandmogorestore\">Mongodump and Mogorestore</h2>\n<p>These both export and imort BSON respectively, including any meta data and indexes you have set up.</p>\n<p>To dump &quot;mydatabase&quot; run:</p>\n<pre><code>mongodump -d mydatabase\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a dump folder in your current directory containing the BSON files.</p>\n<p>To restore you just need to specify the dump folder from the previous step:</p>\n<pre><code>mongorestore yourDumpFolder\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can specify any host and port numbers too, along with user name and password if you are restoring a remote server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aggregationoperations\">Aggregation operations</h2>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/\">Mongo aggregation quick reference</a> for Mongo piplelines.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>match</li>\n<li>project</li>\n<li>sort</li>\n<li>skip</li>\n<li>limit</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongo-shell/\">Mongo shell documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hacksparrow.com/mongoskin-tutorial-with-examples.html\">Mongoskin tutorial</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/\">Mongo db processes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MongoDBx+M101x+3T2015/courseware/4cf555e7a26d4fbb87503adf07ef03ce/c3e3774b53c94688b15335d15b304744/\">Edx course</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mongodb-the-definitive/9781449344795/ch04.html\">Safari online</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smyl.es/how-to-count-the-number-of-values-found-for-a-field-in-mongodb-using-node-js-and-mongoose-using-aggregation/\">Aggregation</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Words describing the attributes of things. But the main thing is the thing, as it were. A thing then would be a resource, whether it be users, products, articles, comments. You name it. Things usually belong in a hierarchy too, like <code>/users/posts/comments</code>. This is a hierarchical structure:</p>\n<pre><code>groups/group-id/members\ngroups/group-id/members/user-id -&gt; individual information\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we have the idea of collections. <code>index.html</code> used to be used as the main page in a website. Really, the index is what it is; it should list the contents of the current directory. Same with REST. The slash in a url then means a hierarchy. You shouldn't really have a trailing slash though.

    "md": "<p><a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> is a task runner. A virtual assistant as it were. It is there to make your life easier, doing all of the &quot;grunt&quot; work. However, this assistant speaks its own language, so in order to get the assistant to assist, we have to speak in the language it understands.</p>\n<p>Ok, so what sort of thing can this assistant do? Lots! And the list is expanding. Things like concatenating js and css files, compiling scss and sass files into css, running test scripts, setting up a local server and reloading the page you are working on when you save files. See I told you! What is also great is these tasks can be chained and you can create custom commands when you want to just test, deploy, or whatever.</p>\n<p>You will probably use Grunt a lot when you get used to it, so it's better to install it globally:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g grunt\n</code></pre>\n<p>And also the command line interface:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g grunt-cli\n</code></pre>\n<p>First you create a <code>Gruntfile.js</code> which will contain all our tasks to run.</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = function(grunt) {\n  grunt.initConfig({});\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Grunt uses Node.js, so if you have used Node before the module.exports will look familiar. If you haven't then don't worry about it. What happens is that grunt looks for this file, loads it, and then runs any command parameters you pass in, such as <code>grunt build</code> or <code>grunt test</code>. If you don't specify any command parameters, then the &quot;default&quot; command will be run.</p>\n<p>Before we do anything with our code it is best to lint it first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jshint\">JS Hint</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint\">grunt-contrib-jshint</a> is the module for running <a href=\"http://jshint.com/\">JS Hint</a>. This is essential for development as it catches typos, syntax errors, structural issues, and those pesky JavaScript idiosyncrasies. We specify what files we want to lint with <code>files: []</code>. We can also add various options. If we are using jQuery for example, we can specify <code>$</code> to be global, so no errors will be raised. Likewise for running in a browser, having access to the <code>window</code> namespace we just specify <code>browser:true</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>jshint: {\n  files: [\n    'public/client/**/*.js'\n  ],\n  options: {\n    globals: {\n      $: false\n    },\n    browser: true,\n    devel: true\n  }\n},\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"concatenatingfiles\">Concatenating files</h2>\n<p>Concatenating all of our javascript files into one js file minimises http requests on the client side therefore speeding things up.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat\">grunt-contrib-concat</a> module concatenates distributed files into one destination file. I think &quot;dist&quot; stands for distribution, as the src files can be from different locations.</p>\n<pre><code>concat: {\n  options: {\n    separator: ';',\n  },\n  dist: {\n    src: ['public/client/app.js', 'public/client/link.js'],\n    dest: 'public/js/app.min.js',\n  },\n},\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"uglify\">Uglify</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify\">grunt-contrib-uglify</a> compresses your source files (source file in this case) therefore reducing the file size.</p>\n<pre><code>uglify : {\n  js : {\n    files : {\n      'public/js/app.min.js' : 'public/js/app.min.js'\n    }\n  }\n},\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"sass\">SASS</h2>\n<pre><code>grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-sass');\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"watching\">Watching</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch\">grunt-contrib-watch</a></p>\n<pre><code>watch: {\n  files: ['&lt;%= jshint.files %&gt;'],\n  tasks: ['jshint', 'mochaTest']\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"registeringtasks\">Registering tasks</h2>\n<p>Ok, so we have added the above, now what. We need to associate those tasks with the command line parameters so we can do things like <code>grunt test</code> or in the case below <code>build</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>grunt.registerTask('build', [\n  'default'\n]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the task build just points to the default task, which could be something like:</p>\n<pre><code>grunt.registerTask('default', [\n  'jshint',\n  'test',\n  'concat',\n  'uglify'\n]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>One thing to note is that these tasks are run sequentially - jshint first, then test.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/\">Grunt is not weird and hard</a></p>\n"

It is a great introduction AND it is built into the console!</p>\n<h2 id=\"absolutebasics\">Absolute basics</h2>\n<p>For this example, in a terminal run <code>vim</code>.</p>\n<p>There are two modes: command mode and edit mode. You will be in command mode by default. Command mode means just that, commands to do things to the current document. To make a change press 'i' to get into 'insert mode'. Type something.</p>\n<p>To get out of insert mode, press esc or ctrl + c.</p>\n<p>Now save the file in the current directory by typing <code>:w first.txt</code>.</p>\n<p>To exit, type <code>:q</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup\">Setup</h2>\n<p>Totes before doing anything, create a <code>.vimrc</code> file.

Well, that might be a little over the top, but I have been in the US a while now. But yeah, this is a really great course. Highly recommended.</p>\n<p>The Lean UX cycle is pretty much build, measure, learn. Taking small deliberate steps moving from doubt to certainty. I say doubt because that is what it is, or it could be &quot;confidence&quot;. However, that confidence might be false. You have to really find out if what you are building is needed, wanted, useful, and will be used. The steps are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build rapid prototypes to test market assumptions</li>\n<li>Get feedback</li>\n<li>Produce MVP</li>\n<li>Repeat from 1</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To get an idea of what Lean UX is about, checkout <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szr0ezLyQHY\">this video by Nordstrom</a>. These guys do weekly sprints, and base themselves directly where the target audience are - in the middle of a store! This is the heart of design thinking. It is also the fundamental of Affinity too - how can you create something for someone if you are too far removed? The &quot;reality&quot; factor won't be there. If you are in the store you could just grab someone and say &quot;would you mind telling me what you think about this&quot;. The Nordstrom team are tasked to fail 80% of the time. Yes, really. One of the most beneficial things I have learned in recent years is to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhxcFGuKOys\">fail more</a>. Not only fail more, but fail often. This definitely takes the nervousness out of development. It also means that you have to do the right thing 20% of the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overviewofleanux\">Overview of Lean UX</h2>\n<p>Lean UX is moving from doubt to certainty. Taking small steps towards that certainty. Starting with a hypothesis statement such as <code>We believe that doing xxx for yyy will achieve zzz</code> then stating all the assumptions the premise is based on. Decide and work out what the first test of those assumptions. Create an MVP. Get out and find your audience. Get the team aligned towards the target. Repeat. In summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>State your desired outcome</li>\n<li>Declare your assumptions</li>\n<li>Hypothesise write the first test</li>\n<li>Make an mvp</li>\n<li>Get out of the building</li>\n<li>Team synthesis</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To gain that certainty one is on the right path one has to compare where we are to where we want to be, or where the user should be. I like this idea as it ties in with testing and use of metrics <code>We'll know this when we see xxx market feedback</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.popapp.in\">Popapp.in</a> is a great rapid prototyping tool</li>\n</ul>\n"

I mean <strong>really</strong> dirty. Especially when you started out using tables for layouts (I even felt dirty doing that, even though others felt it was fine).</p>\n<p>There was always a designer who insists that content order is rearranged depending on the device - content in a different order on mobile vs desktop. That &quot;dirty&quot; feeling starts to surround me.</p>\n<p><strong>NOW CAN WE PLEASE START USING FLEXBOX?</strong> … or <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/\">grid</a> :-)</p>\n<p>I say f*ck it. We are all about progressive enhancement and have been for years. I say if you want to work on bleeding edge projects then use it. If there is money riding on older browsers, then that's too bad, use the dirty table layout. But thankfully things like React native are using it!</p>\n<p>Flexbox is a flexible <strong>layout system</strong> (an algorithm for positioning elements, whether floated, inline, table, grid) add on. So when I say <strong>flexible</strong> layout system, I mean flexible in lots of ways. Reordering content is a breeze. Resizing is a pleasure.</p>\n<p>It is a little tricky to get your head around it to begin with, like a lot of things in the industry, so first I'd suggest going through some of the resources below to get a good grounding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h2>\n<dl>\n  <dt>axis</dt>\n  <dd>the flow in which elements flow, vertical or horizontal<dd>\n  <dt>cross axis</dt>\n  <dd>opposite to the parent axis<dd>\n  <dt>flex-container</dt>\n  <dd>a parent container that contains flexible child <b>flex-items</b></dd>\n  <dt>flex-items</dt>\n  <dd>nested child elements that adjust to parents size</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2 id=\"basics\">Basics</h2>\n<p>Layouts are based on parent layout containers and flexible child containers. What this means is when the parent containers are resized, the children automatically adjust.</p>\n<p>You start off with a container element, a <strong>flex container</strong>, and set the display attribute like so: <code>display: flex;</code> (add any browser prefixes as necessary). You can also set it to <code>display: inline-flex</code> if you want it to be inline. Then we can go ahead and fill it with child elements. You don't have to specify any attributes on the child elements, they will automatically become child flex items.</p>\n<p>There is another concept to cover - the main and cross axis. X and Y if you like. This is the flow direction, either x or y, main or cross.</p>\n<p>I created <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/CSS-Flexbox-Example\">an example</a> on github.

When trying to remember these codes I get a lot of 404s from my brain; so I'm listing them out for my future self. Hashtag #futureself.</p>\n<p>I got these originally from Marty Hall's great JSP and Servlet course.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>100-199</strong> - You should do something else</li>\n<li><strong>200-299</strong> - Success</li>\n<li><strong>300-399</strong> - She don't live here anymore, maybe there will be a forwarding address</li>\n<li><strong>400-499</strong> - You messed up</li>\n<li><strong>500-599</strong> - I messed up</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"100199\">100-199</h2>\n<h3 id=\"100continue\">100 (Continue)</h3>\n<p>If the server receives an Expect request header with a value of 100-continue, it means the client is asking if it can send an attached document in a follow-up request. The server should either respond with status 100 to tell the client to go ahead or use 417 (Expectation Failed) to tell the client it won't accept the document.</p>\n<h3 id=\"101switchingprotocols\">101 (Switching Protocols)</h3>\n<p>A 101 status indicates that the server will comply and change to a different protocol.</p>\n<h2 id=\"200299\">200-299</h2>\n<h3 id=\"200ok\">200 (OK)</h3>\n<p>200 means that everything is fine. The document follows for GET and POST requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"201created\">201 (Created)</h3>\n<p>A status code of 201 means that the server created a new document in response to the request; the Location header should give its URL.</p>\n<h3 id=\"202accepted\">202 (Accepted)</h3>\n<p>A value of 202 tells the client that the request is being acted upon, but processing is not yet complete.</p>\n<h3 id=\"203nonauthoritativeinformation\">203 (Non-Authoritative Information)</h3>\n<p>A 203 status signifies that the document is being returned normally, but some of the response headers might be incorrect since a document copy is being used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"204nocontent\">204 (No Content)</h3>\n<p>A status code of 204 stipulates that the browser should continue to display the previous document because no new document is available. This behaviour is useful if the user keeps reloading the page, you can determine that the previous page is already up-to-date.</p>\n<h3 id=\"205resetcontent\">205 (Reset Content)</h3>\n<p>A value of 205 means that there is no new document, but the browser should reset the document view. This status code is used to force browsers to clear form fields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"206partialcontent\">206 (Partial Content)</h3>\n<p>A status code of 206 is sent when the server fulfils a partial request that includes a Range header.</p>\n<h2 id=\"300399\">300-399</h2>\n<h3 id=\"300multiplechoices\">300 (Multiple Choices)</h3>\n<p>A value of 300 signifies that the requested document can be found several places, which will be listed in the returned document. If the server has a preferred choice, it should be listed in the Location response header.</p>\n<h3 id=\"301movedpermanently\">301 (Moved Permanently)</h3>\n<p>The 301 status indicates that the requested document is elsewhere; the new URL for the document is given in the Location response header. Browsers should automatically follow the link to the new URL.</p>\n<h3 id=\"302found\">302 (Found)</h3>\n<p>This value is similar to 301, except that the URL given by the Location header should be interpreted as a temporary replacement, not a permanent one.</p>\n<p>With a 302 you could follow the Location response header.</p>\n<p>This status code is sometimes used interchangeably with 301. For example, if you erroneously ask for <a href=\"http://host/~user\">http://host/~user</a> (missing the trailing slash), some servers will reply with a 301 code while others will use 302.</p>\n<p>Technically, browsers are only supposed to automatically follow the redirection if the original request was GET. For details, see the discussion of the 307 status code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"303seeother\">303 (See Other)</h3>\n<p>The 303 status is similar to 301 and 302, except that if the original request was POST, the new document (given in the Location header) should be retrieved with GET.</p>\n<h2 id=\"304notmodified\">304 (Not Modified)</h2>\n<p>When a client has a cached document, it can perform a conditional request by supplying an If-Modified-Since header to indicate that it only wants the document if it has been changed since the specified date. A value of 304 means that the cached version is up-to-date and the client should use it. Otherwise, the server should return the requested document with the normal (200) status code. Servlets normally should not set this status code directly. Instead, they should implement the getLastModified method and let the default service method handle conditional requests based upon this modification date. An example of this approach is given in Section 2.8 (An Example Using Servlet Initialisation and Page Modification Dates).</p>\n<h2 id=\"305useproxy\">305 (Use Proxy)</h2>\n<p>A value of 305 signifies that the requested document should be retrieved via the proxy listed in the Location header.</p>\n<h2 id=\"307temporaryredirect\">307 (Temporary Redirect)</h2>\n<p>The rules for how a browser should handle a 307 status are identical to those for 302. Follow redirected GET and POST requests in the case of 303 responses; follow redirected GET but not POST requests in the case of 307 responses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"400badrequest\">400 (Bad Request)</h2>\n<p>A 400 status is bad syntax in the client request.</p>\n<h2 id=\"401unauthorised\">401 (Unauthorised)</h2>\n<p>A value of 401 signifies that the client tried to access a password-protected page without proper identifying information in the Authorisation header. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header. For an example, see Section 4.5, “Restricting Access to Web Pages.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"403forbidden\">403 (Forbidden)</h2>\n<p>A status code of 403 means that the server refuses to supply the resource, regardless of authorisation. This status is often the result of bad file or directory permissions on the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"404notfound\">404 (Not Found)</h2>\n<p>The infamous 404 status tells the client that no resource could be found at that address. This value is the standard “no such page” response. It is such a common and useful response that there is a special method for it in the HttpServletResponse class: sendError(&quot;message&quot;). The advantage of sendError over setStatus is that, with sendError, the server automatically generates an error page showing the error message. Unfortunately, however, the default behaviour of Internet Explorer 5 is to ignore the error page you send back and displays its own, even though doing so contradicts the HTTP specification. To turn off this setting, go to the Tools menu, select Internet Options, choose the Advanced tab, and make sure “Show friendly HTTP error messages” box is not checked. Unfortunately, however, few users are aware of this setting, so this “feature” prevents most users of Internet Explorer version 5 from seeing any informative messages you return. Other major browsers and version 4 of Internet Explorer properly display server-generated error pages. See Figures 6–3 and 6–4 for an example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"405methodnotallowed\">405 (Method Not Allowed)</h2>\n<p>A 405 value indicates that the request method (GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, etc.) was not allowed for this particular resource.</p>\n<h2 id=\"406notacceptable\">406 (Not Acceptable)</h2>\n<p>A value of 406 signifies that the requested resource has a MIME type incompatible with the types specified by the client in its Accept header. See Table 7.1 in Section 7.2 (HTTP 1.1 Response Headers and Their Meaning) for the names and meanings of the common MIME types.</p>\n<h2 id=\"407proxyauthenticationrequired\">407 (Proxy Authentication Required)</h2>\n<p>The 407 value is similar to 401, but it is used by proxy servers. It indicates that the client must authenticate itself with the proxy server. The proxy server returns a Proxy-Authenticate response header to the client, which results in the browser reconnecting with a Proxy-Authorisation request header.</p>\n<h2 id=\"408requesttimeout\">408 (Request Timeout)</h2>\n<p>The 408 code means that the client took too long to finish sending the request.</p>\n<h2 id=\"409conflict\">409 (Conflict)</h2>\n<p>Usually associated with PUT requests, the 409 status is used for situations such as an attempt to upload an incorrect version of a file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"410gone\">410 (Gone)</h2>\n<p>A value of 410 tells the client that the requested document is gone and no forwarding address is known. Status 410 differs from 404 in that the document is known to be permanently gone, not just unavailable for unknown reasons, as with 404.</p>\n<h2 id=\"411lengthrequired\">411 (Length Required)</h2>\n<p>A status of 411 signifies that the server cannot process the request (assumedly a POST request with an attached document) unless the client sends a Content-Length header indicating the amount of data being sent to the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"412preconditionfailed\">412 (Precondition Failed)</h2>\n<p>The 412 status indicates that some precondition specified in the request headers was false.</p>\n<h2 id=\"413requestentitytoolarge\">413 (Request Entity Too Large)</h2>\n<p>A status code of 413 tells the client that the requested document is bigger than the server wants to handle now. If the server thinks it can handle it later, it should include a Retry-After response header.</p>\n<h2 id=\"414requesturitoolong\">414 (Request URI Too Long)</h2>\n<p>The URI is too long. In this context, &quot;URI&quot; means the part of the URL that came after the host and port in the URL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"415unsupportedmediatype\">415 (Unsupported Media Type)</h2>\n<p>A value of 415 means that the request had an attached document of a type the server doesn't know how to handle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"416requestedrangenotsatisfiable\">416 (Requested Range Not Satisfiable)</h2>\n<p>A status code of 416 signifies that the client included an unsatisfiable Range header in the request.</p>\n<h2 id=\"417expectationfailed\">417 (Expectation Failed)</h2>\n<p>If the server receives an Expect request header with a value of 100-continue, it means that the client is asking if it can send an attached document in a follow-up request. In such a case, the server should either respond with this status (417) to tell the browser it won't accept the document or use 100 to tell the client to go ahead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"500internalservererror\">500 (Internal Server Error)</h2>\n<p>Something broke on the server, owch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"501notimplemented\">501 (Not Implemented)</h2>\n<p>The 501 status notifies the client that the server doesn't support the functionality to fulfil the request. It is used, for example, when the client issues a command like PUT that the server doesn't support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"502badgateway\">502 (Bad Gateway)</h2>\n<p>Used by servers that act as proxies or gateways indicating that the initial server got a bad response from the remote server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"503serviceunavailable\">503 (Service Unavailable)</h2>\n<p>Either the server is down through maintenance or overloading. The server can supply a Retry-After header to tell the client when to try again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"504gatewaytimeout\">504 (Gateway Timeout)</h2>\n<p>Used by servers that act as proxies or gateways indicating that the initial server didn't get a response in time from the remote server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"505httpversionnotsupported\">505 (HTTP Version Not Supported)</h2>\n<p>HTTP version in the request line is not supported.</p>\n"

    "md": "<p>In the beginning I was using functions that interacted with the DOM - time consuming and messy. Then we had libraries like jQuery, MooTools, Yahoo etc, equally messy. Then we had MV* such as Backbone, pretty cool. However, not really great for complex apps. Same for Angular, better to begin with, but full of new problems.</p>\n<p>Ideally we want to use web components, but humans have a history of not getting along, so web components are not standard yet.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, React is just a stepping stone to web components; funnily enough everything in React is a component. Just like an HTML5 input slider - or even a select input - these are just web components - reusable components used with a custom tag and parameters set with attributes. These components have low coupling and high cohesion - you can work on these as separate entities, but they can all work together to create an app. Great for large teams or large projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>Man, creating apps for a browser isn't easy. Loading libraries, plugins for those libraries, searching for a boilerplate - oh wait, we're not using THAT boilerplate anymore, this one is much better, blah blah and all that other shizzle ... I mean, what a drag. So lets use Facebooks boilerplate command line tool - Create React App.</p>\n<pre><code>npm i -g create-react-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I usually learn by doing a lot of smaller apps I set up my working directory like this. The node_modules folder is at the top level and is referenced via a <code>symlink</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir starter &amp;&amp; cd starter\ncreate-react-app .\nmv node_modules ..\nln -s ../node_modules node_modules\nrm src/App.css src/App.test.js src/App.js src/index.css src/logo.svg\n</code></pre>\n<p>That will create a folder we can copy from:</p>\n<pre><code>cp -a starter mynewapp\n</code></pre>\n<p>The -a flag copies the simlink instead of the full node_modules folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"components\">Components</h2>\n<p>As mentioned before, we are creating a bridge to Web Components, so the key is in the name 'components'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testingreact\">Testing React</h2>\n<p>Almost all tutorials don't start with unit tests. Then they say at the end you should unit test. Unit tests are immensely important, nay, essential to having clean code and a great app.</p>\n<p>Jest is installed with the create react app, so thats a good start. There are a few more components needed though.</p>\n<p>Best practice seems to use enzyme, and once you start using it you see why.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react react-test-renderer\nnpm install --save-dev enzyme react-addons-test-utils\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"virtualdom\">Virtual DOM</h2>\n<pre><code>React\n  .Children\n    .map\n  .Component\n  .DOM\n  .cloneElement\n  .createClass\n  .createElement\n  .createFactory\n  .findDOMNode\n  .render\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the name suggests, react creates a virtual representation of the DOM, which is a lot faster than using the actual DOM. Then react renders that representation by creating actual DOM elements and then inserting them into the real DOM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jsxandprecompilers\">JSX and pre-compilers</h2>\n<p>First off, you don't have to use <a href=\"https://jsx.github.io/\">JSX</a>, however most people do. JSX is an XML transpiler, that was created to integrate React.</p>\n<h2 id=\"props\">Props</h2>\n<p>React components have props - properties. Props are passed to the createComponent function, or passed in as properties to the constructor.</p>\n<p>In React, data flows just one way. Props are read only and can only be passed down to children.</p>\n<p>Properties can be passed as attributes on jsx elements. Javascript expressions need to be around a single curly brace:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Header tagline='My awesome tagline' time={Date.now()} /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Child component receives a prop named onAction, which it can call whenever it needs to send up data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/\">React documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/lessons/react-building-a-react-js-app-up-and-running-with-react-and-webpack\">React up and running</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/\">Guide to building apps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://richardkho.com/a-beginners-guide-to-reactjs/\">Beginners guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daveceddia.com/getting-started-with-tdd-in-react\">Dave Ceddia</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>Binary is cool. For me, learning binary was the &quot;WOW&quot; moment that got me hooked on programming. That moment I could see how HDDs worked, and how the whole machines were just running like clockwork. Anyhoo, so we have these bits, and we can do things with them, efficiently.</p>\n<p>Lets imagine today was brought to you with the numbers 5 and 9.</p>\n<pre><code> //columns -&gt; 8 4 2 1\nvar a = 5; // 0 1 0 1\nvar b = 9; // 1 0 0 1\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"and\">AND</h2>\n<p>Logical <strong>And</strong> operations look through each column and return true if both bits are true, and false if they're not:</p>\n<pre><code>(a &amp; b); // = 1\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"or\">OR</h2>\n<p>Logical <strong>Or</strong> operations look through each column and return true if one or both columns are true:</p>\n<pre><code>(a | b); // = 13\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"xor\">XOR</h2>\n<p><strong>XOR</strong>, exclusive or, or the &quot;one and only&quot;. These operations look through each column and return true if one and only one of the columns are true.</p>\n<pre><code>(a ^ b); // = 12\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"not\">NOT</h2>\n<p>Logical <strong>Not</strong> looks through columns and flips them. What the tilde actually does is this: -(x + 1). So the right hand operand has 1 added to it, and then is turned into a negative. ~5 becomes -6. ~-6 becomes 5.</p>\n<p>We can use a double tide (NOT NOT) binary operator instead of using <code>Math.floor</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>var a = 5.34556\n~~a; //5\nMath.floor(a); //5\n</code></pre>\n<p>It can also be used for indexOf. So instead of doing <code>myVar.indexOf(&quot;a&quot;) !== -1</code> you can do <code>~myVar.indexOf(&quot;a&quot;)</code>. so if &quot;a&quot; is in myVar, say at index 0, and negated, so it gets +1, then negated, so -1 - which is true. If it is not in the index, its result is -1, which has 1 added to it, then negated, which takes it to 0 - which is false.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leftshift\">Left shift</h2>\n<p>The left shift operator literally shifts the bits to the left by the value specified.</p>\n<pre><code>//double\na &lt;&lt; 1; //10\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>//quadruple\na &lt;&lt; 2; //10\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"rightshift\">Right shift</h2>\n<p>The right shift operator, like the left shift, shifts the bits. In this case it shifts them to the right hand side.</p>\n<pre><code>20 &gt;&gt; 2 //5\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bateru.com/news/2011/03/javascript-binary-operations-the-easy-way/\">http://bateru.com/news/2011/03/javascript-binary-operations-the-easy-way/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9070937/adding-two-numbers-without-operator-clarification\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9070937/adding-two-numbers-without-operator-clarification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://michalbe.blogspot.com/2013/03/javascript-less-known-parts-bitwise.html\">http://michalbe.blogspot.com/2013/03/javascript-less-known-parts-bitwise.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.joezimjs.com/javascript/great-mystery-of-the-tilde/\">http://www.joezimjs.com/javascript/great-mystery-of-the-tilde/</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Websockets enable this by establishing a persistent connection between client and server where both parties can send data at any time.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const net = require('net');\nconst PORT = 8888;\n\nconst server = net.createServer((socket) =&gt; {\n  console.log('created server');\n  socket.on('data', (data) =&gt; {\n    socket.write('pong\\n');\n  });\n  socket.pipe(connection);\n});\n\nserver.listen(PORT);\n\nconst client = net.createConnection({ port: PORT }, () =&gt; {\n  console.log('created client');\n  setInterval(() =&gt; {\n    client.write('ping');\n  }, 1000);\n});\n\nclient.on('data', (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log('client got data', data.toString());\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"websockets\">Websockets</h2>\n<p>A websocket is a persistent socket. Any interchange, from client or server or both, doesnt need to send a packet, the header is 8 bytes unline an ajax call that is 1200, latency is 50-60ms rather than 500ms with ajax. It's a bit more resource intensive when scaling.</p>\n<p>The api is similar from client to server. Listen to events by <code>.on</code> then send with <code>.emit</code>. A broadcast event doesnt exist on client, or is not necessary. Broadcast sends an event to all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"socketio\">Socket.io</h2>\n<p>Example client interacting with socket.io api.

Check out <a href=\"http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\">the comtability tables</a> too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tailcall\">Tail Call</h2>\n<p>Doing recursive calls in Javascript eats up the memory as each call is added onto the call stack. Asymptotically it is O(n). That is because Javascript is not a proper tail recursive language. That is until now. Proper tail recursion causes no memory increase over time when a recursive function is called. In current browsers a recursive function would break if it called itself ~10K. With proper tail call language the asymptotic behaviuour is O(1).</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt>Tail position</dt>\n  <dd>The last instruction to fire before the return statement</dd>\n  <dt>Tail call</dt>\n  <dd>An instruction in a tail position that is a function call</dd>\n  <dt>Close call</dt>\n  <dd>A call that looks like a tail call but isnt. It maintains the stack as in return 1 + myMethod()</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The main thing to keep in mind when doing recursion is to pass everything to the recursive function - don't leave a scope reference as that will add to the call stack.</p>\n<p>At the moment it is not very widely supported at all :'(</p>\n<h2 id=\"variablesvarletandconst\">Variables - Var, Let and Const</h2>\n<h3 id=\"var\">var</h3>\n<p>You have to understand what <code>var</code> does before you understand <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. <code>var</code> is hoisted to the top of the function it is defined in during the compilation stage and it is function scope.</p>\n<p>Redeclaring the same variable with <code>var</code> is a no-ops, meaning it skips the step of allocating disc space for the variable and continues on to assigning a value to it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"let\">let</h3>\n<p><code>let</code> has a block level scope, rather than function scope. It is ideal in for loops or &quot;flag&quot; variables as it is not hoisted like <code>var</code>.</p>\n<p>Redefining a variable with let throws an error:</p>\n<pre><code>let a = 0;\nlet a = 1;\n//Syntax error, identifier has already been declared\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using <code>let</code> over <code>var</code> is preferred as it makes your code mirror how it is going to be compiled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"const\">const</h3>\n<p><code>const</code> as the name suggests is a constant value. Any attempt to reassign the value results in an syntax error. Any redeclaration throws an error.</p>\n<p><code>const</code> and <code>let</code> affords more information to the software engineer, rather than seeing 'var' everywhere.</p>\n<p><code>const</code> is block scope just like <code>let</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"temporaldeadzone\">Temporal Dead Zone</h3>\n<p>You cant access the variable you have used in your code until it is declared. Sounds weird.</p>\n<p><code>let</code> is not hoisted, however, memory is allocated when it is compiled. You'll then get a reference error if you try to use that varible before it's been declared. It's much preferred over getting <code>undefined</code> with <code>var</code>.</p>\n<p>Again, <code>let</code> adds to the predictablity and readability of your code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strings\">Strings</h2>\n<p>Strings now allow templating. We used to concat strings manually using the <code>+</code> operator. Now we can use the <code>\\</code> back tick instead of a single or double quote. In that string we can insert varaibles using <code>${myVar}</code></p>\n<p>A cool method on a string is <code>repeat</code>, which, as the name suggests, repeats the string the specified number of times:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;Bart simpson says I must write this 10 times&quot;.repeat(10);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"restparameters\">Rest parameters</h2>\n<p>You know how we have always had access to the <code>arguments</code> object, which is kind of like an array, but not quite? Rest params are so much better than arguments.</p>\n<p>We used to have to do <code>var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);</code> to get an actual array of arguments. The rest param is so much better. Now all we do is name our param but prefixed by a <code>...</code>. As in:</p>\n<pre><code>let showArgs = (...args) =&gt; args;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h3>\n<p>Rest params must be the last in a list of parameters. When it is used it has reference to all the arguments after the last named argument.</p>\n<p>You can't use more than one either.</p>\n<p>You can't use it with <code>arguments</code> - its either one or the other.</p>\n<p>No default values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spreadoperators\">Spread operators</h2>\n<p>The spread operator is <code>...</code>. Looks familiar huh? It is used before an array to pull each value out. It saves you from manually targeting elements of an array.</p>\n<p>Instead of using <code>apply</code> with an array:</p>\n<pre><code>let multiply = (a, b) =&gt; a * b;\nmultiply.apply(null, [5, 5]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>... you can just call the function:</p>\n<pre><code>let args = [5, 5];\nmultiply(...args);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"defaultparametervalues\">Default parameter values</h2>\n<p>Just like PHP you can now set default values for parameters. If any parameter is falsy, it is set to the default.</p>\n<pre><code>let formatBalance = (balance = 0, name = 'Unknown', currency = '£') =&gt;\n  `${name}, your balance is ${currency}${balance}`;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This saves us from having to do things like:</p>\n<pre><code>function myFunction (a, b) {\n  a = a || 0;\n  b = b ? b : 0;\n  //...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Default parameters are lexically scoped too:</p>\n<pre><code>let count = 0;\nlet increment = (i = count) =&gt; {\n  let count; //lexically scoped\n  return ++count;\n}\n\nincrement(); //NaN\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also set a default value to a function call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>You can't set a default on a Rest param, so no doing:</p>\n<pre><code>function myFunction (...args = [1,2,3]) { ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Default values do no get included in the arguments object:</p>\n<pre><code>function myFunction (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) {\n  console.log(arguments.length);\n}\n\nmyFunction(); //0\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"destructuring\">Destructuring</h2>\n<p>&quot;Destructuring allows you to bind a set of variables to a corresponding set of values anywhere that you can normally bind a value to a single variable&quot;</p>\n<p>Destructuring objects and arrays. With objects we destructure by taking attributes and their values. The thing being destructured MUST be an object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"objects\">Objects</h3>\n<pre><code>let getUserById = id =&gt; {\n  return {\n    name: 'Sally',\n    age: 26,\n    location: 'Los Angeles'\n  };\n};\n\n//Destructuring\nlet {name, age, location} = getUserById(1);\n\n//Old style\n//let user = getUserById(1); //so it would be user.name, user.age\n\nconsole.log(`${age} year old ${name} from ${location}`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have braces on the LHS assignment. The &quot;Destructuring Pattern&quot; is the <code>{name, age, location}</code>. The variables in the destructure must reference the attributes targeted in the object.</p>\n<p>If you want different names to those in the object you can do it by specifying the actual name then a colon followed by the alias:</p>\n<pre><code>let {name: n, age: a, location: l} = getUserById(1);\nconsole.log(`${a} year old ${n} from ${l}`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If a function takes an object as a parameter then you can target variables that way too:</p>\n<pre><code>let doSomethingWithUserObject = ({name, age, location}) =&gt; {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even better with default values:</p>\n<pre><code>let formatBalance = ({ balance: b = 0, name: n = 'Unknown', currency: c = '£'}) =&gt;\n  `${n}, your balance is ${c}${b}`;\n\nformatBalance({ balance: 10 });\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"arrays\">Arrays</h3>\n<p>Similar to Objects we target array elements by their position, and use the square bracket indicating an array rather than a curly brace for an object.</p>\n<pre><code>let winners = ['Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'Jack', 'Sally', 'Jon'];\nlet [winner, second, third,,, last] = winners;\nconsole.log(winner, second, third, last);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"arrowfunctions\">Arrow functions</h2>\n<p>This implementation is based on Coffeescript. Coffeescript has two versions of arrow functions - skinny and fat arrows.</p>\n<p>An Arrow function is an anonymous function, meaning it is best not to use it as a method or anywhere you refer to &quot;this&quot;.</p>\n<p>Use parentheses for a function that takes no parameters. If we don't use curly braces for the function body the expression after the <code>=&gt;</code> is returned. In the case below, <code>null</code> is always returned:</p>\n<pre><code>let myFunction = () =&gt; null;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we are passing one parameter we can omit the parenthesis. This is optional though.</p>\n<pre><code>let myFunction = val =&gt; null;\nmyFunction = (val) =&gt; null;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we are passing multiple parameters:</p>\n<pre><code>let myFunction = (a, b, c) =&gt; null;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we are using Rest params we must wrap it in parentheses:</p>\n<pre><code>let myFunction = (...params) =&gt; params;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The return values for all of the above can be exchanged with curly braces and a return statement.</p>\n<pre><code>let myFunction = (...params) =&gt; {\n  return params;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Arrow functions by default bind the parameter this to the lexical context. What this means is Arrow functions do not have their own &quot;this&quot;, instead it is inherited from the &quot;surrounding&quot; scope.</p>\n<p>Briefly, the parameter &quot;this&quot; refers to 5/6 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Global context</li>\n<li>Function context (which is global)</li>\n<li>A method i.e. the &quot;this&quot; refers to the thing to the left of the dot</li>\n<li>&quot;call&quot;, where the parameter this is the first argument</li>\n<li>&quot;apply&quot;, just like #4</li>\n<li>&quot;bind&quot;, similar to #4 and #5 where the argument is the object to be bound</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The timers <code>setTimout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> used to be awkward where we either had to bind the callback function or create a reference such as <code>var that = this</code>. Now we can use an arrow function and the context is maintained.</p>\n<p>This binding can be awkward. With the example below we are adding a method on an object called 'bob'.</p>\n<pre><code>let bob = {\n  name: &quot;Bob&quot;,\n  sayHello: function () {\n    return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;\n  }\n};\n\nbob.sayHello(); //returns &quot;Hi, I'm bob&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we tried it with an Arrow function we would get an error:</p>\n<pre><code>let bob = {\n  name: &quot;Bob&quot;,\n  sayHello: () =&gt; {\n    return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;\n  }\n};\n\nbob.sayHello(); //Throws an error\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lets try it with a constructor function. This works:</p>\n<pre><code>let Person = function (name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.sayHello = () =&gt; {\n    return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;\n  }\n};\n\nlet bob = new Person('bob');\nbob.sayHello(); //returns &quot;Hi, I'm bob&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now lets try it with <code>bind</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>let Person = function (name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.sayHello = function () {\n    return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;\n  }\n}\n\nlet bob = new Person('bob');\nlet bill = new Person('bill');\nbob.sayHello(); //Hi, I'm bob\nbob.sayHello.bind(bill)(); //Hi, I'm bob\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can see that <code>bind</code> doesn't do as we thought. That's because you can't alter the <code>this</code> on Arrow functions.</p>\n<p>So the rule is to still use <code>function</code> when it is suitable. I'm just going to use <code>function</code> as methods rather than Arrow functions, unless I really don't want the <code>this</code> parameter to be overridden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"classes\">Classes</h2>\n<p>I was asked in an interview recently if I used &quot;classical inheritance&quot; using ES6 Class or whether I used prototypal inheritance and which one was better. I blushed and was slightly confused. ES6 Class is &quot;syntactical sugar&quot; around prototype-based inheritance. The guy didn't really know what he was talking about so I didn't take the job - imagine all that terrible code to inherit, shudder.</p>\n<p>So you know that functions can be used as a constructor, so that it takes the parameter this, constructs a new object, sets it to 'this' and returns it. The convention is that we name the constructor function with an Uppercase first letter so we can distinguish between a function and a constructor function. Now, we can use the class keyword. So instead of this:</p>\n<pre><code>function Animal () { ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>we can do:</p>\n<pre><code>class Animal { ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>A class has a constructor function, called <code>constructor</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>class Animal {\n\n  constructor (type) {\n    this.type = type;\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you don't specify a constructor, it will look through any parent classes, if none then it goes defaults to creating an object and returning it.</p>\n<p>Methods are added like this:</p>\n<pre><code>class Dog {\n\n  constructor (name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  annoy () {\n    return &quot;Bark ... &quot;.repeat(10);\n  }\n\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to overide a method and then call the parent method you do so with the <code>super</code> keyword:</p>\n<pre><code>communicate () {\n  return super.communicate('woof woof') + '!!';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unlike function declarations, Classes aren't hoisted so you have to declare it first.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getters\">Getters</h3>\n<p>So a getter is a function that returns a value, but you don't call it like a normal function using parenthesis, you just use the property name:</p>\n<pre><code>class Animal {\n\n  constructor (type) {\n    this.type = type;\n  }\n\n  get type () {\n    return this.type;\n  }\n\n}\n\nlet dog = new Animal('mamal');\nconsole.log(dog.type);\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"setters\">Setters</h3>\n<p>Setters as the name suggests, sets values. It is used just like the getter, a function corresponds to a value. There is reason for caution with setters though. Let's say we had the setter below on the Animal class:</p>\n<pre><code>  set type (type) {\n    this.type = type;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would cause an infinite loop, throwing a Range error - maximum stack size exceeded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"symbols\">Symbols</h2>\n<p>There is a new datatype in Javascript, the Symbol. I didn't grok symbols straight away, but they are pretty cool. Symbols are unique and immutable. They key thing is &quot;unique&quot;, never giving you the same one twice.</p>\n<p>A great use for Symbol is private variables in classes:</p>\n<pre><code>let Animal = (() =&gt; {\n\n  let animalType = Symbol('type');\n\n  return class Animal {\n\n    constructor (name, type) {\n      this.name = name;\n      this[animalType] = type;\n    }\n\n    get type () {\n      return this[animalType];\n    }\n\n  }\n\n}());\n\nlet a = new Animal('dog', 'mamal');\nconsole.log(a.name);\nconsole.log(a.type);\na.type = 'reptile'; //Type error\n\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"classinheritance\">Class Inheritance</h2>\n<p>You can easily extend a class by using the <code>extends</code> keyword, followed by the ancestor:</p>\n<pre><code>class Dog extends Animal {\n\n  constructor (name) {\n    super('Dog', 'mamal');\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  bark () {\n    return this.communicate('woof woof');\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"promises\">Promises</h2>\n<p>So we've all used libraries like Q or Bluebird - and Promises in jQuery - so the ES6 Promise is a welcome addition to the language. I mean, they are great, but not as great as Observables in Functional Reactive Programming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thepromiseconstructor\">The Promise constructor</h3>\n<p>To create a promise, you need to pass in the function which takes to parameters, one to handle a successful operation and an error handling function:</p>\n<pre><code>return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"thepromiseinstance\">The Promise Instance</h3>\n<p>A promise can be in 1 of 4 states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fulfilled: resolved - 1</li>\n<li>rejected: 2</li>\n<li>pending: either rejected or resolved hasn't happened yet - undefined</li>\n<li>settled: either rejected or resolved has occured - 1 or 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you get a promise returned, you call the then the <code>then</code> method, takes in your resolve, reject functions:</p>\n<pre><code>funcThatReturnsPromise()\n  .then(result =&gt; {\n    return result + ' worked';\n  }, error =&gt; {\n    return 'didn\\'t work';\n  };\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can do chaining too. If you want to do something with the resolved data you can pass it on:</p>\n<pre><code>funcThatReturnsPromise()\n  .then(function (result) {\n    return result + ', chained once';\n  })\n  .then(function (result) {\n    return result + ', chained twice';\n  })\n  .then(function (result) {\n    return result + ', chained thrice';\n  })\n  .then(function (result) {\n    result.should.eql('later, chained once, chained twice, chained thrice');\n  })\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; {\n    return reason;\n  });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that you can put your reject handler in the <code>.catch</code> method too. If anything breaks along the chain, it &quot;bubbles up&quot; and is caught in the last catch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"promiseall\">Promise.all</h3>\n<p>Promise.all takes an array of promises/functions that return a promise, and waits for all of them to complete. The result of which is an array containing all the values returned from the promises:</p>\n<pre><code>Promise.all([app.promise.later(), app.promise.later(), app.promise.later()])\n  .then((values) =&gt; {\n    //values should equal ['later', 'later', 'later']\n  });\n</code></pre>\n<p>If any of them fail then you can catch it as before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"promiserace\">Promise.race</h3>\n<p>Promise.race takes an array of promises/functions that return a promise, and uses the first promise that has completed in the resolve function:</p>\n<pre><code>Promise.race([app.promise.slow(), app.promise.medium(), app.promise.fast()])\n  .then((result) =&gt; {\n    // result should equal 'fast!'\n  });\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"modules\">Modules</h2>\n<p>A module is a single object or a function in a file. The code in the file is made available by the <code>export</code> keyword.</p>\n<p>It has features from common.js and AMD. It has cycical dependancies, so if you load two or more modules that depend on each other then that is OK.</p>\n<h3 id=\"importandexport\">Import and export</h3>\n<p>The <code>export</code> object is just that, an object. It can be a function object, and you can attach other things to that object.</p>\n<pre><code>export\n</code></pre>\n<p>To set the default export:</p>\n<pre><code>class Animal {\n  constructor () {}\n};\nexport default Animal;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Aliasing:</p>\n<pre><code>class Animal {\n  constructor () {}\n};\nexport {Animal as Creature};\n</code></pre>\n<p>To import:</p>\n<pre><code>import Animal from 'Animal';\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use aliases.</p>\n<pre><code>import { concat, reduce } from 'underscore';\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>import * as _ from 'underscore';\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"programaticloadingsystemimport\">Programatic Loading - System.import</h2>\n<p>It's based on Promises.</p>\n<pre><code>System.import('Animal').\n  then(Animal =&gt; {\n    //...\n  }).\n  catch(error =&gt; {\n    //...\n  });\n</code></pre>\n<p>System methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>System.import(module) //returns Promise</li>\n<li>System.module(module, options) //returns Promise</li>\n<li>System.set(name, module) //register a new module</li>\n<li>System.define(name, source, ...options) //</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The module tag: <module import=\"animal.js\"></module></p>\n<h2 id=\"collectionsmapssetsandweakmaps\">Collections - Maps, Sets and Weakmaps</h2>\n<h3 id=\"set\">Set</h3>\n<p>A set data structure is a collection, like an array, however it's values are unique.</p>\n<p>To create an instance of a set:</p>\n<pre><code>let alphabet = new Set();\nalphabet.add('a');\nalphabet.add('b');\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>or you can pass an array as a param to be used for the set:</p>\n<pre><code>let alphabet = new Set(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Set methods:</p>\n<pre><code>alphabet.size; //26\nalphabet.has('a'); //true\nalphabet.has(2); //false\nalphabet.delete(2); //false\nalphabet.clear(); //resets the collection\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"fetch\">Fetch</h2>\n<p>The Fetch api is an interface to 'fetch' resources. It will be used to supersede XMLHttpRequest.</p>\n<p>With fetch, the first argument is mandatory (the resource URI), and then it returns a promise.</p>\n<pre><code>fetch('http://localhost:3000/authors')\n  .then(data =&gt; JSON.parse(data))\n  .then(console.dir);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"map\">Map</h2>\n<p>Map is a key/value object.</p>\n<pre><code>let teamA = new Map();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Map methods:</p>\n<pre><code>teamA.set('Bob Smith', 'Striker');\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use objects as the key:</p>\n<pre><code>let bobSmith = {\n  name: 'Bob Smith',\n  age: 32\n};\nteamA.set(bobSmith, 'Striker');\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"weakmap\">Weakmap</h2>\n<p>Weakmap is like a map but different. It doesn't keep track of the values inside. The thing with a WeakMap is its keys and garbage collection. You can't have primitive values for keys, only objects.

Generator functions are paused and continued by use of the <code>yield</code> keyword. Think of it like the <code>return</code> keyword, although there can be multiple ones sequentially.  Generators implement the iterator protocol, so when a generator function is called, an iterator object is returned e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>{ value: 3, done: false }\n{ value: undefined, done: true }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>function *basicGenerator() {\n  yield console.log(1); // pauses\n  yield console.log(2); // continues on next call\n  yield console.log(3); // ...\n}\n\nconsole.log('Generator function');\nconst iterator = basicGenerator();\niterator.next(); //&gt; 1\niterator.next(); //&gt; 2\niterator.next(); //&gt; 3\niterator.next(); //&gt;\nconsole.log(iterator.next()); //&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"asyncandawait\">Async and Await</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) {\n  return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      resolve(x);\n    }, 2000);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction resolveAfter3Seconds(x) {\n  return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      resolve(x);\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function add1(x) {\n  var a = resolveAfter2Seconds(20);\n  var b = resolveAfter3Seconds(30);\n  var aa = await a;\n  console.log('after aa');\n  var bb = await b;\n  console.log('after bb');\n  return x + aa + bb;\n}\n\nadd1(10).then(v =&gt; {\n  console.log(v);  // prints 60 after 2 seconds.\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php\">ECMAScript wiki</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/jsnext-es6\">Frontend Masters ES6 course</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://exploringjs.com/es6/\">Exploring ES6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/es6-whats-new-next-version-javascript/\">Smashing magazine</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/#leanpub-auto-browser-and-nodejs-compatibility\">es6 and node compatibility</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla\">Mozilla deveoper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/\">Mozilla hacks arrow functions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://es6katas.org/\">ES6 Katas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/tag/javascript-ecmascript-harmony-coffeescript/\">brendaneich.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.uxebu.com/blog/2015/06/learn-ecmascript-6-in-a-different-way/\">uxebu.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/nstieglitz/5-great-features-in-es6-harmony\">wintellect.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features/blob/master/README.md\">lukehoban on Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://coryrylan.com/blog/javascript-es6-class-syntax\">coryrylan.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/7-surprising-things-i-learned-writing-a-fibonacci-generator-4886a5c87710\">Eric</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol\">Mozilla docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>It has been said that there are two types of developer, the Wizard and the Scribe. Myself, I think I fall somewhere in between. The Scribe in me needs to know the definitions of words used, and also the context. Sometimes, especially when the pressure is on, I just do something that works without knowing the finer details, explaining things in a hand-wavy fashion. Not ideal. This is why, time permitting, I like to go back over code and dissect things, learning the finer points. Knowing the exact meaning of &quot;Lexical Scope&quot; is one of those things. Knowing the finer details helps when communicating about your code your code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lexicalscope\">Lexical Scope</h2>\n<p>The definition given in Wikipedia is &quot;the portion of source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies.&quot; Let's split this into individual words.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lexical\">Lexical</h2>\n<p>Let's start off with the definition of &quot;Lexical&quot;. I remember at Uni, one time our lecturer asked us &quot;what is a Lexicon?&quot; I was the only one who knew the meaning. It is simply a dictionary, or a vocabulary of something. The actual derivation is &quot;book of words&quot;. So what? Well, why is &quot;lexical&quot; used with scope? JavaScript (I'm not including ECMAScript 6 which has block level scoping here) uses functional scope, not block level scope like some other languages. Any of the variables defined within the function body can be accessed from anywhere within that function. This means that a &quot;dictionary&quot; or &quot;lexicon&quot; of the variables are created for the scope of the given function. We can further define a <a href=\"/2015/07/19/closures/\">closure</a> as a functional object that has reference to the lexical scope it was created in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scope\">Scope</h2>\n<p>The definition of scope in this context comes from &quot;the extent, or area, or subject matter that is being dealt with or relevant.&quot; A more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)\">programming related definition of scope</a> is on Wikipedia. So here we are, a Lexical Scope refers to the function's list of variables declared within it.</p>\n"

I was wrong.</p>\n<p>Functional Reactive is a different programming paradigm. Things like Facebook's React have used the words <a href=\"http://digioli.co.uk/2015/08/03/a-glossary-of-sorts/#imperative\">&quot;Imperative&quot;</a> and <a href=\"http://digioli.co.uk/2015/08/03/a-glossary-of-sorts/#declarative\">&quot;Declarative&quot;</a>. Essentially what &quot;imperative&quot; means is programming a solution using loops and if statements, describing how the problem is to be solved, in a step-by-step manner. What declarative means is just that, what needs to be solved. &quot;I hereby declare ...&quot;. This is exactly what FRP facilitates, and it uses Observables.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2>\n<p>Tracking state in async programs quickly becomes a nightmare. Just recently, updating someones React code was a nightmare because of listeners dotted around. FRP is easier to scale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisanobservable\">What is an Observable?</h2>\n<p>Observable === Collection + Time</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>a sequence of values that a data producer pushes to the consumer. It can also signal that it has completed.</p>\n<p>That latter one is a complicated way of saying it is an array with a special api. For example, you can't repeat an asynchronous function with a loop; you can when it is an observable. So just a recap on higher order functions:</p>\n<p>forEach applies the callback function to each of the items in a collection:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">[1,2,3].forEach(x =&gt; console.log(x));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Map applies the callback to every item in the collection, creating a new value, then creates a new array with the results of applying that function to each value in the array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">[1,2,3].map(x =&gt; x + 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Filter is a test function, it applies a test to every single value and if it passes the test it gets added to the new array that is returned:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">[1,2,3].filter(x =&gt; x + 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So using an observable:</p>\n<pre><code>var mouseMoves = Observable.fromEvent(element, 'mousemove');\nvar subscription = mouseMoves\n  .forEach(\n    event =&gt; console.log(event),\n    error =&gt; console.log(error),\n    () =&gt; console.log('done')\n  );\n\nsubscription.dispose();\n</code></pre>\n<p>With DOM event handlers, old school would be like this:</p>\n<pre><code>var button = document.getElementById('myButton');\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function () {\n  ...\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Observable would be like:</p>\n<pre><code>var button = document.getElementById('myButton');\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {},\n  function (error) {},\n  function () { console.log('done'); }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>OR, you can pass an object:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n\tonNext: function (event) {},\n\tonError: function (error) {},\n\tonDone: function () {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To create an observable object all you need to do is provide a standard observable api. Four things are important:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What streams do we have, or functions that give me streams</li>\n<li>What do I want to create</li>\n<li>Map, filter, retry into the stream we want</li>\n<li>Consume data and put it on screen</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Observable.fromEvent is a function that turns an event into an observable.</p>\n<p>The difference between forEach on an Array and an Observable is that with an Array, the loop waits until the next value arrives. With an Observable, a value is pushed to the client whenever it arrives.</p>\n<pre><code>function Observable (forEach) {\n  this._forEach = forEach;\n}\n\nObservable.prototype = {\n  forEach: function (onNext, onError, onCompleted) {\n    if (typeof onNext !== 'function') {\n      return this._forEach({\n        onNext: onNext,\n        onError: onError || function () {  },\n        onCompleted: onCompleted || function () {  }\n      });\n    } else {\n      return this._forEach(onNext);\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nObservable.fromEvent = function (dom, eventName) {\n  return new Observable(function forEach (observer) {\n    var handler = function (event) {\n      observer.onNext(event);\n      dom.addEventListener(eventName, handler);\n      return {\n        dispose: function () {\n          dom.removeEventListener(eventName, handler);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n};\n\nvar obs = new Observable(function (observer) {});\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"corefunctions\">Core Functions</h2>\n<p>forEach, map, and filter all look at one value at a time so is ideal for changing each item or running a test condition against it. Reduce looks at two pieces of information and compares values so it is ideal for mathematical operations or things like finding the greatest length.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhusain\">Jafar Husain's</a> <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/asynchronous-javascript/\">Excellent RxJs course</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reactivex.io/learnrx/\">Learn Rx interactively</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/content/guidelines/introduction/index.html\">xgrommx functional introduction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/series/introduction-to-reactive-programming\">Egghead.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.introtorx.com/\">Intro to Reactive extensions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reactivex.io/tutorials.html\">Reactivx tutorials</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://raimohanska.github.io/bacon.js-slides/1.html\">Bacon.js slides</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://abesto.net/bacon-js-on-the-server/\">Bacon.js on the server</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29299079\">UStream TV</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028250/what-is-functional-reactive-programming/1030631#1030631\">What is functional programming?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rxmarbles.com/\">Rx Marbles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx-node\">Reactive Extensions for Node</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.hyphe.me/rxjs-testing-in-real-world-applications/\">Rx testing in the real world</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/content/getting_started_with_rxjs/testing_and_debugging.html\">Rx Book</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/testing.md\">Reactive extensions</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

You can do a lot more than just &quot;run&quot; and &quot;test&quot;.</p>\n<p>I've used Grunt (mainly) and Gulp build tools, but using npm is so much better IMHO. You can use a combination of these build tools if you want, nothing in this universe is totally black or white. Whatever works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"runningscripts\">Running scripts</h2>\n<p>We're used to running scripts like <code>npm test</code> and <code>npm start</code>, so running your npm scripts are similar except with &quot;run&quot; added: <code>npm run my-cool-script</code>. The &quot;start&quot; and &quot;test&quot; omit the &quot;run&quot; as a shortcut.</p>\n<h2 id=\"operators\">Operators</h2>\n<p>NPM also has some operators you can use with your scripts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&gt;</code> compiles the lhs into the rhs file, i.e. <code>browser/js/main.js &gt; public/js/app.js</code></li>\n<li><code>|</code> pipes lhs into rhs, i.e. <code>browserify browser/js/main.js | uglifyjs --compress --mangle &gt; public/js/app.js</code></li>\n<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code> run commands sequentially, i.e. <code>lint &amp;&amp; mocha</code></li>\n<li><code>&amp;</code> runs commands in parallel i.e. <code>npm run watch-css &amp; npm run watch-js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"typesofscripts\">Types of scripts</h2>\n<p>For this example I'm going to categorise scripts into test, build (JavaScript, SASS/SCSS, other assets), and watch. There are others you may want to use such as deploy, pre-build et al. What I want my scripts to do is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>run tests on our JavaScript</li>\n<li>convert our SASS/SCSS files into css</li>\n<li>concat, uglify, and export JavaScript into the public/js folder</li>\n<li>in dev mode, watch our server files and restart on change</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tests\">Tests</h2>\n<p>We can leave our default <code>test</code> for individual tests but setup a watcher for our test files. Mocha has a flag <code>-w</code> which will run tests, and then watch for changes in the &quot;test&quot; directory by default. I'm going to include any &quot;linting&quot; in this stage too.</p>\n<p>In our script we can add this:</p>\n<pre><code>  &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;mocha&quot;,\n    &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;jshint app.js server/*/*.js client/js/*.js&quot;,\n    &quot;watch-test&quot;: &quot;mocha -w&quot;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"builds\">Builds</h3>\n<h4 id=\"sassscss\">SASS/SCSS</h4>\n<p>For our SASS/SCSS files we can use &quot;node-sass&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code>  &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;mocha&quot;,\n    &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;jshint app.js server/*/*.js client/js/*.js&quot;,\n    &quot;watch-test&quot;: &quot;mocha -w&quot;,\n    &quot;build-css&quot;: &quot;node-sass --include-path scss client/scss/main.scss public/css/style.css&quot;,\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"javascript\">JavaScript</h4>\n<p>What we want to do is concatenate our files together, and then minify it. We can do this with &quot;browserify&quot; and &quot;uglify&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code>  &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;mocha&quot;,\n    &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;jshint app.js server/*/*.js client/js/*.js&quot;,\n    &quot;watch-test&quot;: &quot;mocha -w&quot;,\n    &quot;build-css&quot;: &quot;node-sass --include-path scss client/scss/main.scss public/css/style.css&quot;,\n    &quot;build-js&quot;: &quot;browserify client/js/main.js | uglifyjs --compress --mangle &gt; public/js/app.js&quot;,\n    &quot;watch-css&quot;: &quot;nodemon -e scss -x 'npm run build-css'&quot;,\n    &quot;watch-js&quot;: &quot;nodemon --watch client/js -x 'npm run build-js'&quot;,\n    &quot;watch-server&quot;: &quot;nodemon --watch app.js --watch server&quot;,\n    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;npm run watch-js &amp; npm run watch-css &amp; npm run watch-test &amp; npm run watch-test&quot;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice the pipe operator &quot;|&quot; which pipes the result of calling &quot;browserify&quot; to &quot;uglify&quot;.</p>\n<p>I'm using &quot;nodemon&quot; and setting it to watch any files with the &quot;.scss&quot; extension to trigger the &quot;build-css&quot; script. Likewise for the JavaScript files, any changes in &quot;client/js&quot; will trigger the &quot;build-js&quot; script.</p>\n<p>I'm also setting &quot;nodemon&quot; to run our server too. &quot;dev&quot; brings it all together at this point with the script &quot;dev&quot;. Running &quot;npm run dev&quot; will build the scripts, css, and run tests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"githubrepo\">Github repo</h2>\n<p>I've set up a <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/npm-script\">basic github repo</a> for the above. npm rocks!</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run\">Substack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script\">npm scripts documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.npmjs.org/post/118810260230/building-a-simple-command-line-tool-with-npm\">npm blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.modulus.io/using-npm-scripts-to-build-asset-pipeline\">modulus.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jayway.com/2014/03/28/running-scripts-with-npm/\">jayway</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/\">Keith Cirkel</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

That course covered <abbr title=\"Jackson Structured Programming\">JSP</abbr>, <abbr title=\"System specification and design methodology\">SSADM</abbr>, Flow Schemas, <abbr title=\"Common Business Oriented Language\">COBOL</abbr>, a smidgeon of C. Such a great course. That was just before the Millennium Bug - hence learnign COBOL.</p>\n<p>I decided to take my knowledge further by starting a BSC (hons) in Multimedia Computing at Northumbria University. That course was great because I could use the experience I had with Video and Animation and combine it with programming. It was a &quot;sandwich course&quot; meaning the third year was a placement. I got a job with the School of the Built Environment at the same University and had a great time. I still have friends from there today.</p>\n<p>After graduating I got a job with the University web team, led by a great guy called Christ Thompson. He was the one who got me into CSS and semantic HTML. I learned a lot from him. Also learned from a great programmer called Paul Diston who taught me a lot too.</p>\n<p>Next step was working for 'The Design Group'. They did a lot of work for Proctor and Gamble so I worked on some cool projects. I wasn't as famous as washing powder, but I did build a site for Lenor 'in the pink' fabric softener. That was a great one. That came well under deadline, quality code too. The company was an old fashioned design studio for print unfortunately, so they didn't push the digital side of things.</p>\n<p>The next opportunity for me was a contract role with the Home Housing group. What a great bunch of people they are Jawad, Malcolm, Andy, Ronan. I had such a great time with them and did a lot of really interesting work. I learned a lot from Lee McIvor who was the lead dev and gave me my first break.</p>\n<p>I went on to doing sites for Nigel Wright recruitment, IMAS, Benfield Motors, Profero, BBC WW, LBi, AKQA, Yell.com, Macmillan English Campus, DK/Penguin (Idiotsguides.com, dkfindout.com), Home Office.</p>\n<p>I've had a lot of experience over the years working with various technologies. I got into crypto the tail end of 2015 when I heard Vitalik Buterin give a talk on Ethereum. I felt that this was a game changer.

But that is something that cannot be guaranteed.</p>\n<p>So you are building your API, service, or App. We have Alpha, Beta, Live, yeah, but how do these relate to semantic versioning? Versioning is important. Semantic versioning refers to the format of <strong>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</strong>, so a major version would be <strong>1.0.0</strong> and a patch on the major version would be <strong>1.0.1</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"major\">Major</h2>\n<p>The above is all fine and good, but what does &quot;Major&quot; mean?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Major</strong> version when you make incompatible API changes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn't mean &quot;I've added a shed load of new features&quot; so I'm going to release them all at once. Major actually means &quot;If you used the last version, this version won't work for you&quot; or &quot;Oh, that is the older version, we don't do stuff like that anymore&quot;. Get your wallet out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"minor\">Minor</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>MINOR</strong> version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is when you have added a new feature or features.</p>\n<h2 id=\"patch\">Patch</h2>\n<p>Patch, or in other words bug fixes or security fixes. So you released version 1, added some features, but now something is broken and you have to get the fix out asap. This is where you increment the last digit/s i.e. <strong>1.3.1</strong>. This means for version 1, feature version 3, there was one patch released.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimportanceofversioning\">The Importance of Versioning</h2>\n<p>Why is versioning important? Well one time I was working on a VBScript app that also used C++ and there were files called <abbr title=\"Dynamically Link Library\">dll</abbr> files. That is where I learned about &quot;dll hell&quot;. Different versions of these files were old and incompatible. It was so difficult to find which version was correct. This is why in your package.json file, the two most important parts are the name and the version. You will not be able install your package if either or both of these are missing. The version is an essential part and must reflect the current status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tc2UgG5L7WM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://semver.org/\">Semantic versioning</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json\">npm package.json documentation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scotch.io/tutorials/node-and-npm-version-numbering-guide-and-best-practices\">Node and npm best practices</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging\">Git tagging</a></p>\n"

Thats it. You use these every day.</p>\n<p>To solve a task you have to understand what the outcome should be, break down into steps and sub-steps how to achieve that goal, then do each in order. If that actually achieves a goal then the algorithm is correct.</p>\n<p>There are some caveats. The algorithm might be correct, but is it efficient? In order to establish the worth of something it needs to be compared to something else. Efficiency is broken down further into space and time. If an algorithm is correct, but it takes a long time, then this is not good. If an algorithm is correct, but you need lots of space to do it, then this is not good.</p>\n<p>An algorithm should be as simple as possible. We live in a world where we care about each other, and are striving to achieve a future of magnificence, therefore an algorithm should be communicable. If an algorithm is correct, fast, efficient, but nobody can grok it, then it is useless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fibonaccithegoldenratio\">Fibonacci - the Golden Ratio</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci\">Fibonacci</a> was an Italian mathematician from the Italy. He discovered the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\">Golden Ratio</a> which is a ratio that occurs in nature. This ration is approximately 1.6.</p>\n<p>The sequence of numbers are calculated by adding the previous numbers together to get the next number in the sequence.</p>\n<pre><code>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>so:</p>\n<pre><code>0 + 1 = 1 // [0, 1]\n1 + 1 = 2 // [1, 1]\n1 + 2 = 3 // [1, 2]\n2 + 3 = 5 // [2, 3]\n3 + 5 = 8 // [3, 5]\n</code></pre>\n<p>... and so on.</p>\n<p>The bigger the numbers, the more accurate the golden ratio (1.6). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>1 2/1 = 2.000000\n2 3/2 = 1.500000\n3 5/3 = 1.666666\n5 8/5 = 1.600000\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a number sequence. If we are given a number in this sequence, a very big number, how would we find out what the next value is? One algorithm would be to <code>start from the beginning and work out each number until we get to our given number</code>. That would be a correct algorithm. It would not be time efficient.</p>\n<h2 id=\"geometry\">Geometry</h2>\n<p>Geometry comes from Greek meaning 'to measure the earth'. Today it means a branch of mathematics which covers topics as relations, properties, and measurement of solids, surfaces, lines, and angles.</p>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <rect x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"30\" height=\"30\"/>\n</svg>\n<p>Example: square root, take the area of a square, perform square root calculation, obtain the root of the square i.e. the length of one side.</p>\n<p>We started off with a number, which could represent a length of a line. Then we took that number/line (root) and created a square from it.</p>\n<p>What if we drew a diagonal line in that square from one corner to the opposite? We would then have 2 right angle triangles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pythagarastheorem\">Pythagaras' Theorem</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras\">Pythaogras</a> was a Greek philosopher and mathematician who made many discoveries.</p>\n<p>The right angled triangle is something that comes in very handy.

Then using the Twillio API we got a telephone number that users could text their emotion to words or emoticons:</p>\n<pre><code>'wonderful': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'awesome': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'positive': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'excited': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'happy': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'super': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'energetic': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  'excited': { &quot;sentiment.emotionType&quot; : &quot;positive&quot; },\n  ':-D': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.6, $lt : 0.9 } },\n  ':D': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.6, $lt : 0.9 } },\n  ':‑)': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.4, $lt : 0.8 } },\n  ':-))': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.5, $lt : 0.4 } },\n  ':)': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.5, $lt : 0.4 } },\n  ':o)': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.4, $lt : 0.3 } },\n  ':]': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.3, $lt : 0.2 } },\n  ':3': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.2, $lt : 0 } },\n  ':c)': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.2, $lt : 0 } },\n  ':&gt;': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.2, $lt : 0 } },\n  '=]': { &quot;sentiment.score&quot; : { $gt : 0.2, $lt : 0 } },\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not bad for less than 12 hours work ;-)</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk\">IBM Watson node SDK</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Instead lets create a standard container, known dimensions, structure etc, then we can put what we want inside, and then transport it as a single unit. Wow.</p>\n<p>Docker enables us to package an app with all its dependencies as a single unit. When I say app I mean a component, a single process whether it be an Nginx server, a frontend Javascript App, an API, an instance of Elasticsearch, whatever.</p>\n<p>Lets cover <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/glossary/\">a few definitions first</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"definitions\">Definitions</h2>\n<dl>\n<dt>Container</dt>\n<dd>A cut down version of Linux</dd>\n<dt>Dockerfile</dt>\n<dd>A file containing a list of commands to build an image</dd>\n<dt>Image</dt>\n<dd>Software you load onto a container. A saved state</dd>\n<dt>Docker Engine</dt>\n<dd>A background service that lets you create and manage containers</dd>\n<dt>Docker Hub</dt>\n<dd>Registry of docker images</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Docker is Linux based, meaning it needs to run on a flavour of Linux. A container is a 'cut down' version of Linux, which means it appears to be an operating system. This is the foundation of Docker. Next you want to load your software you want to run. So you would do that with a Dockerfile - instructions of what to install, add users, run scripts, etc. This installs into an image. That image can be started or stopped.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/\">best practices</a> for useful tips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"namespaces\">Namespaces</h2>\n<p>When a container process is started the kernel makes a lot of information available to it in its own isolated views via <strong>namespaces</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are 6 namespaces that containers use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>mount</strong> - provides file system access</li>\n<li><strong>uts</strong> - host and domain name</li>\n<li><strong>ipc</strong> - Unix Interprocess Communication</li>\n<li><strong>network</strong> - its own unique and isolated network access</li>\n<li><strong>pid</strong> - its own pid table</li>\n<li><strong>usr/user</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"themountnamespace\">The mount namespace</h2>\n<p>The mount namespace gives processes belonging to the namespace a separate list of mount points that it doesn't share with other processes.</p>\n<p>When images are loaded, all their drives are mounted using a Union File System (UFS), so containers referencing <code>/data</code> for example all have access to that same folder because the UFS 'unions' all those apparent individual /data directories. Think of UFS as a layer of files and directories, when another layer is added, folders and files at the upper-most layer are the ones that will be used. This is how source code can be installed and run locally, mounted onto a container, and the container has its own installation folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"utsnamespace\">UTS namespace</h2>\n<p>UTS is the unix timesharing hostname domain name of your machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ipcunixinterprocesscommunication\">IPC - Unix interprocess communication</h2>\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/\">Beej's guide</a> for this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"networknamespace\">Network namespace</h2>\n<p>The network namespace allocates another copy of the entire networking stack with its own routes firewall rules and network devices.. When Docker starts it automatically creates three networks.</p>\n<p>To see the network run:</p>\n<pre><code>docker network ls\n</code></pre>\n<p>To create a new network:</p>\n<pre><code>docker network create testnetwork\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you spin up a container you can specify the network. Then you can add others onto the same network:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run -d --name bob --net=testnetwork mycontainer\n\ndocker run -d --name pete --net=testnetwork mycontainer\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overlay networks, can be a bit hairy. And Bridged networks too. To get the ip address you can run <code>ip a</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"theusernamespace\">The user namespace</h2>\n<p>The user namespace provides a mapping from uid and gid outside the namespace to a different set inside the namespace. docker will map the specified user to be root inside the container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"containersandimages\">Containers and Images</h2>\n<p>Containers are created from images, which in turn are created from Dockerfiles.</p>\n<p>The <code>docker run</code> command takes a minimum of one argument - an image name. If you pass in the name of an image that doesn't exist locally, docker will go ahead and look for it on the &quot;public registry&quot; and then &quot;pull&quot; it if it exists.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to create Docker images. Create an image from a running container, or programatically using a Dockerfile (preferred method). An elementary process for finding and using containers and images would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create your <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com\">Docker hub</a></li>\n<li>Search for containers at <a href=\"https://cloud.docker.com/container/list/\">Docker cloud</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/\">Tag</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_six/\">push, pull your image</a></li>\n<li>Push to a <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets\">Digital ocean droplets</a> or similar</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Containers use a few tools by which the resources given to a process are controlled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cgroup - memory, bulk io, cpu, and devices</li>\n<li>pivot root</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The memory cgroup limits memory so it won't take up too much resources. You can specify the amount using the <code>-m</code> flag, so <code>-m 100</code> would mean 100 MB.</p>\n<p>same goes for CPUs, <code>--cpuset-cpus 0</code> would set the container to only use one CPU. You can also supply a range (eg 0-2) or a combination such as <code>0-2,6,8</code>.</p>\n<p>pid is given a new process tree with pid 1 in that tree. If pid 1 dies, all other process in that tree are ungracefully terminated. So if we run a container we can see the pid will be 1:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run -it --rm debian ps aux\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nroot         1  0.0  0.0   9084   816 ?        Rs+  19:18   0:00 ps aux\n</code></pre>\n<p>The unshare tool allows you to start a process with its new namespace. <code>sigint</code> is usually ctrl + c, sends an interrupt signal, which terminates the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dockercommands\">Docker Commands</h2>\n<p>Get a list of commands used in docker by:</p>\n<pre><code>docker\n</code></pre>\n<p>List all running containers:</p>\n<pre><code>docker ps\n</code></pre>\n<p>or to list all containers:</p>\n<pre><code>docker ps -a\n</code></pre>\n<p>To list all images:</p>\n<pre><code>docker images\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running an image takes the format of <code>docker run [options] image [command] [args]</code></p>\n<pre><code>docker run imagename\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remove the image:</p>\n<pre><code>docker rmi imagename\n</code></pre>\n<p>Stats:</p>\n<pre><code>docker stats\n</code></pre>\n<p>A full list of commands can be displayed with <code>man docker</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dockerfile\">Dockerfile</h2>\n<p>Dockerfiles are named <code>Dockerfile</code> with no extension or spaces. Just like Makefiles, the convention is to start with a capital letter. Your docker file will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>FROM [image]\nMAINTAINER [your name] [&lt;your@email.com&gt;]\nRUN [do something]\nRUN [do something]\nADD [some files]\nEXPOSE [port number]\nCMD [command 1, command 2]\nENTRYPOINT [command args]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"dockerfilecommands\">Dockerfile Commands</h3>\n<p>The <code>FROM</code> instruction specifies which base image to start from.</p>\n<p>Then the convention is to add the <code>MAINTAINER</code> instruction, which is the owner of the docker image.</p>\n<p>We can then run commands using <code>RUN</code> instruction to issue commands. Just like in the terminal you can concatenate commands by using <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>\n<p>We can add files to the docker image we use the <code>ADD</code> instruction.</p>\n<p>Using <code>WORKDIR</code> sets the current working directory on the image.</p>\n<p>The <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> is the main process that runs in the container. This process will be PID 1. The container lifecycle will be bound to that PID.</p>\n<p>Then to build an image, use the build command:</p>\n<pre><code>docker build .\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also tag to name your image using the <code>-t</code> flag:</p>\n<pre><code>docker build -t namespace/appname .\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 --name [container] -t [image]\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"dockervolumesanddatacontainers\">Docker Volumes and data containers</h2>\n<p>When you run a container data persists for the life span of the container only. In some cases this is not a good thing. In order to persist data we have to expose the host file system, and we can do that in 2 ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specifying VOLUME /some/dir in a Dockerfile</li>\n<li>Specifying it as part of your run command as docker run -v /some/dir</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>VOLUME [host/path] [container/path]\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>docker run ubuntu -v /docker/test:/var/log /bin/echo 'Hello world' &gt; /var/log/test.log\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>docker run -v /Users/markrobson/devrepos/broadband-mongo/dump:/opt/dump -it roppa/broadband-mongo\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>docker create -v /data/db:/data/db roppa/broadband-mongo /bin/true\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above do exactly the same thing, which is telling the host to create a directory in its own filesystem. Either way, these two things do exactly the same thing. It tells Docker to create a directory on the host, within the docker root path (by default /var/lib/docker), and mount it to the path you've specified (/some/dir above). When you remove the container using this volume, the volume itself continues to live on.</p>\n<p>In the real world we are going to run docker images as services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dockertools\">Docker tools</h2>\n<p>More and more tools are starting to appear... Docker compose, Docker machine, Docker swarm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dockercompose\">Docker compose</h3>\n<p>Docker Compose for running the docker-compose command. Containerise application with multiple components. Can start multiple containers, all networked together. Great for dev environments but not recommended for production. It is a list of services that connect together to form the whole application stack in one config yaml file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dockercloud\">Docker Cloud</h2>\n<p>A node is a host for containers. A service is a group of containers. Docker CLI client is for running Docker Engine to create images and containers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kitematic\">Kitematic</h2>\n<p>A Docker GUI. the Docker QuickStart shell preconfigured for a Docker command-line environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cacheandcleaningupafteryourself\">Cache and cleaning up after yourself</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.yohanliyanage.com/2015/05/docker-clean-up-after-yourself/\">Clean up after yourself</a></p>\n<p>For docker instances:</p>\n<pre><code>docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)\ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)\n</code></pre>\n<p>For volumes:</p>\n<pre><code>docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)\n</code></pre>\n<p>With docker compose:</p>\n<pre><code>docker-compose rm &amp;&amp;\n docker-compose pull &amp;&amp;\n docker-compose build --no-cache &amp;&amp;\n docker-compose up -d --force-recreate\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"testingdocker\">Testing Docker</h2>\n<p>A couple of resources are <a href=\"http://blog.terranillius.com/post/docker_testing/\">docker testing</a> and testing with <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bashfv/\">Bash</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you get a timeout error run:</p>\n<pre><code>$ docker-machine restart default # Restart the environment\n$ eval $(docker-machine env default) # Refresh environment settings\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"logging\">Logging</h2>\n<p>Forward request and error logs to docker log collector:</p>\n<pre><code>RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \\\n&amp;&amp; ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet\">Docker cheat sheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/linux/separation-anxiety-isolating-your-system-with-linux-namespaces\">Linux namespaces</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/change_root\">Arch linux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerizing/\">Dockerizing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://container42.com/2014/11/03/docker-indepth-volumes/\">Docker in depth volumes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/mac/\">Docker on Mac OS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.docker.com/what-docker\">What is Docker?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/\">Getting started</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/getting-started/your_first_node/\">Docker cloud - your first node</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockerimages/\">Docker Images</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/\">Nodejs docker guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/dockerizing-a-node-js-web-application\">Dockerising a nodejs app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodesource.com/blog/dockerizing-your-nodejs-applications/\">Dockerising node apps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ericluwj.com/2015/10/20/a-basic-workflow-for-docker-compose-with-mean-stack.html\">Basic MEAN workflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-using-dockerfiles-to-automate-building-of-images\">Digital Ocean</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/\">Docker user guide - networking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/247625/what-is-the-loopback-device-and-how-do-i-use-it\">loopback</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html\">UNIX namespaces</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/\">Volumes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-docker-data-volumes-on-ubuntu-14-04\">How to work with volumes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jdlm.info/articles/2016/03/06/lessons-building-node-app-docker.html\">Lessons building a node app in docker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc\">Liz Rice presentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"othercoolstuff\">Other cool stuff</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/\">Installing on Raspberry Pi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://unitstep.net/blog/2015/12/21/accessing-the-host-filesystem-from-a-docker-container-on-os-x-or-windows/comment-page-1/#comment-1230181\">Mounting a drive</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

In this sense it is a system that can query and work with the data contained in the full text search</dd>\n  <dt>Document</dt>\n  <dd>The data being used as material for the search engine comprising fields extracted using Leucine</dd>\n  <dt>Field</dt>\n  <dd>A key-value extracted from the original document during indexing</dd>\n  <dt>Term</dt>\n  <dd>A word or phrase used for search</dd>\n  <dt>Token</dt>\n  <dd>A string occurring in a field consisting of the text value, start position, offset, and type</dd>\n  <dt>Inverted index</dt>\n  <dd>A lookup table consisting of the unique words in documents in the search index</dd>\n  <dt>Index</dt>\n  <dd>You can think of an index as a MongoDB collection which allows queries</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>So before elasticsearch engineers would hammer an sql database for searches, not great. Imagine all those wild card queries. This is where search engines came in. They take a document as a string, parsing it and analysing string tokens, creating a kind of look up table (an index) based on the content which includes numbers of occurrences and references to the documents etc. Elasticsearch is based on Apache Solr, which in turn uses Apache Leucine. T</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co\">Elasticsearch</a> is a much easier search engine to use than <a href=\"http://digioli.co.uk/2015/07/04/apache-solr/\">Apache Solr</a> I reckon. It also uses JSON so data can be structured or unstructured and makes life much more easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>I personally think the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html\">installation</a> and configuration can be messy - I personally have seen it installed willy-nilly and such a nightmare to trace where folders are all over the shop. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html\">Follow the instructions on their site</a> first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elasticfolderstructure\">Elastic folder structure</h2>\n<p>The installation folder structure looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>elasticsearch\n  \\bin - executables\n  \\config - namely elasticsearch.yml\n  \\data - where data is stored\n  \\lib - libraries used by elasticsearch\n  \\logs - can be changed in config/elasticsearch.yaml\n  \\plugins\n</code></pre>\n<p>As above, because elasticsearch is a standalone app you can put the elasticsearch folder anywhere. Make sure you put it somewhere useful like at the root or /usr/local or /var/etc/. Whatever standard you have that gives consistency.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-dir-layout.html\">example folder layout</a> suggests a folder structure for your app. Again, stick to a convention.</p>\n<h2 id=\"runningelasticsearch\">Running Elasticsearch</h2>\n<p>Navigate to your elasticsearch installation directory. Then in a terminal run:</p>\n<pre><code>./bin/elasticsearch\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or just set up a symlink in your /usr/local/bin to point to that binary. Here is more info on <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-service.html\">starting and stopping service</a>. If you want to setup elasticsearch as a service use  <code>/bin/systemctl start elasticsearch.service</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, in a browser list all indices by visiting</p>\n<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v\n</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously we have nothing there yet, so we will just see something like:</p>\n<pre><code>health status index pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size \n</code></pre>\n<p>You can run elasticsearch specifying the cluster and node in one line:</p>\n<pre><code>elasticsearch --cluster.name randomname --node.name local_dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>To see the cluster health go to:</p>\n<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/_cat/health?v\n</code></pre>\n<p>And for the node health:</p>\n<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?v\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"executingqueries\">Executing queries</h2>\n<p>You can use your browser to interact with Elasticsearch or you can use Curl for running queries in the format below:</p>\n<pre><code>curl -X&lt;REST Verb&gt; &lt;Node&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;/&lt;Index&gt;/&lt;Type&gt;/&lt;ID&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h2>\n<p>Elasticsearch is more like an engine, and you only masturbate over an engine when you really know what your talking about. Instead you need some eye candy to masturbate over, that is where plugins come in.</p>\n<p>There are lots of cool plugins for Elasticsearch. We use <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/downloads/marvel\">Marvel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana\">Kibana</a>.</p>\n<p>Marvel-agent is an interface to Elasticsearch innards and state, helping to spot problems fast and providing an overview of what is going on with the system and deployments. To install, navigate to your elasticsearch installation directory and run:</p>\n<pre><code>./bin/plugin install elasticsearch/marvel/latest\n</code></pre>\n<p>Kibana is an interface to the data, analytics, and a lot more. Just to make things awkward it is actually a stand alone app in itself so it is not a plug in as such, more like a wrapper. Follow <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/setup.html\">the setup instructions</a> first.</p>\n<p>Once you've installed it navigate to the directory and run using:</p>\n<pre><code>cd kibana\nbin/kibana\n</code></pre>\n<p>That runs a node app and it listens on port 5601:</p>\n<pre><code>http://localhost:5601\n</code></pre>\n<p>So remember the comment about running queries? A plugin for Kibana I use for querying is called Sense. To install that, navigate to your kibana installation directory and run:</p>\n<pre><code>./bin/kibana plugin --install elastic/sense\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then in kibana (<a href=\"http://localhost:5601\">http://localhost:5601</a>) you will see the sense plugin, click on it and start running queries inline. So good!</p>\n<h2 id=\"queries\">Queries</h2>\n<p>Create an index:</p>\n<pre><code>PUT /library\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add a record:</p>\n<pre><code>PUT /library/books/1\n{\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Kevin the Chicken&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Putting also updates a document:</p>\n<pre><code>PUT /library/books/1\n{\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Kevin the Chicken&quot;,\n  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The adventures of Kevin&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To run the most basic search do:</p>\n<pre><code>GET /library/_search\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or to get a specific record you can reference the _id:</p>\n<pre><code>GET /library/books/1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can add a query string:</p>\n<pre><code>GET /library/books/_search/?q=Kevin&amp;analyzer=english&amp;default_operator=AND\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can use an object:</p>\n<pre><code>GET /library/books/_search\n{\n  &quot;simple_query_string&quot;: {\n    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;Kevin&quot;,\n    &quot;analyzer&quot;: &quot;english&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html\">Elasticsearch query string documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Deleting a single item:</p>\n<pre><code>DELETE /library/books/1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Deleting an index:</p>\n<pre><code>DELETE /library\n</code></pre>\n<p>Getting metadata:</p>\n<pre><code>GET /library/_stats\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any CRUD type activity usually results in a message like this:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;acknowledged&quot;: true\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can add aliases for an index or indices:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;actions&quot; : [\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-03&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;today&quot; } }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;actions&quot; : [\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-03&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;today&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-02&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;twodays&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-02&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;twodays&quot; } }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;actions&quot; : [\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-03&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;today&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-03&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;twodays&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-02&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;twodays&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-03&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;threedays&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-02&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;threedays&quot; } },\n        { &quot;add&quot; : { &quot;index&quot; : &quot;logs-2018-07-01&quot;, &quot;alias&quot; : &quot;threedays&quot; } }\n    ]\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"ingestionandbatchingestion\">Ingestion and batch ingestion</h2>\n<p>Ingestion is simply adding records into elasticsearch.

However, thats where the reverse proxy comes in (more later).</p>\n<h2 id=\"installingnginx\">Installing Nginx</h2>\n<p>(The below is one way to install Nginx, but you are better off using docker tbh)</p>\n<p>On a Mac you can install using homebrew <code>brew install nginx</code>.</p>\n<p>The default port has been set in <code>/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> to <code>8080</code> so that nginx can run without sudo.</p>\n<p>By default nginx will load all files in <code>/usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/</code>.</p>\n<p>To have <code>launchd</code> start nginx at login:</p>\n<pre><code>ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n</code></pre>\n<p>Set logs: <code>/var/log/nginx</code></p>\n<p>Then to load nginx:</p>\n<pre><code>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run <code>nginx</code></p>\n<p>Take a look at the 'nginx.conf' file. There are four 'contexts' - main, server, upstream, and location. All of these contain 'directives' - instructions for Nginx.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reverseproxy\">Reverse proxy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client as though they originated from the proxy server itself -</p>\n</blockquote>\n<footer><cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)\n<p>With Nginx being asynchronous and a reverse proxy you have to configure all requests for dynamic content to use the <a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html\">upstream module</a>.</p>\n<p>Say you have 2 node apps and a static site.

We would set them up as upstream in our nginx.conf file:</p>\n<pre><code>upstream api {\n    server localhost:8000;\n}\n\nupstream admin {\n  server localhost:8080;\n}\n\nserver {\n\n  location /api {\n    proxy_pass http://api;\n  }\n\n  location /admin {\n    proxy_pass http://admin;\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"directives\">Directives</h2>\n<p>Contexts/block directives are a bit like scope, <code>server {}</code> is a context.</p>\n<p>Directives are key/value pairs like <code>listen: 80;</code></p>\n<pre><code>server {\n  listen: 80;\n  root: '/path/to/your/sites';\n  index: index.html;\n  server: yourdomain.com;\n  location / {\n    default-type: 'text/html';\n  } \n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard directive - Set a value. Can only be defined once within a single context. It can be overwritten by a child context.</li>\n<li>Array directive - set multiple values in single identifier. Can be used multipal times</li>\n<li>Action - performs an action when triggered</li>\n<li><code>try_files</code> will look for files, space separated, in turn until it finds something. If nothing is found you can set a default to <code>=404</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inheritance straight down from parent context http, server, location.</p>\n<p>There are implicit variables available to us, for example the <code>$url</code> which equates to the url <a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html\">nginx variables</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiplesites\">Multiple sites</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-virtual-hosts-server-blocks-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts--3\">Digitalocean has a great tutorial</a> on running multiple sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ssl\">SSL</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com\">Digitalocean</a> have a great tutorial about <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssl-certificate-on-nginx-for-ubuntu-14-04\">how to create an ssl certificate</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key -out /usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"usingwithnode\">Using with Node</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.argteam.com/coding/hardening-node-js-for-production-part-2-using-nginx-to-avoid-node-js-load/\">Using Nginx to avoid 'node load'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.modulus.io/supercharge-your-nodejs-applications-with-nginx\">Supercharge your nodejs applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/blog/5-performance-tips-for-node-js-applications/\">Node.js performance tips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-performance-scaling-proxies-clusters/\">Scaling proxy clusters</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html\">nginx beginners guid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-nginx-configuration-file-structure-and-configuration-contexts\">Digitalocean guid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-how-to-containerize-and-use-nginx-as-a-proxy\">(Docker) How to containerise and use nginx as a proxy</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

They could be thought of the new Angular 1 directives. An Angular 2 app is essentially a tree of components, the root of which is the application component. The application component boostraps the rest of the application.</p>\n<p>Components are based on classes (obviously still based on prototypal inheritance), so they can be extendable and aggregated. Aggregated components and children are rendered recursively.</p>\n<p>A component is made up of three things: a Component Decorator; a View; and a Controller.</p>\n<pre><code>@Component({\n  selector: 'my-title',\n  template: `&lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;`\n})\nclass MyTitle {\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"componentdecorator\">Component Decorator</h3>\n<p>The @Component is the Decorator. This is the <a href=\"#annotation\">annotation</a> which adds meta data to the class that follows. The annotation specifies a selector (telling Angular what element to match) and a template (specifying the view).</p>\n<p>The selector part means angular will look for <code>&lt;my-title&gt;&lt;/my-title&gt;</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View: this is what html we want to render</li>\n<li>Controller: he controller in the above case is the class of MyTitle.</li>\n<li>Models: Angular doesn't have a prescribed model library, so we have carte blanche. I highly recommend some sort of Functional Reactive library like RxJs or Bacon.js.</li>\n<li>Application: an Angular application is just a tree of components. The top level component is what you bootstrap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>'Dude, before I start I have to install 20 things and have a package.json file that is 90 lines long and all I want to do is create a todo list'.

    "md": "<p>Bish bosh bash. Why do lots of boring tasks when they could be automated? Bash something out instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2>\n<p>A lot of Linux scripts are written in Bash, and an understanding of it helps in other areas, such as piping (|) and outputting (&gt;) in npm scripts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how\">How?</h2>\n<p>Using the built in commands as covered in <a href=\"/terminal-velocity\">terminal velocity</a> we can start to pull sequences of commands together in one nice little script. It can be more than running sequentially through commands; you can use it with variables, getting user input, loops, sub scripts et al.</p>\n<p>A great thing about bash scripts is that they don't have to be compiled, it is right there part of the OS.</p>\n<p>To enter bash type <code>bash</code> in the terminal. You'll see something like <code>bash-3.2$</code>.</p>\n<p>Then you can run commands directly with bash:</p>\n<pre><code>echo hello world\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bash is more useful in a script. Create a file (vim hello) add <code>echo hello world</code> and save as 'hello' (no file extension). Navigate to the directory and run:</p>\n<pre><code>bash hello\nhello world\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unix has a standard i/o (input output) model consisting of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>standard input</li>\n<li>standard output</li>\n<li>standard error</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Input could be a mouse or something else but it defaults to keyboard. Output could be a printer or something else but it defaults to a console/screen/monitor. Error is like output, it defaults to console/screen/monitor.</p>\n<p>These are also streams, and like streams they can be channelled and redirected. To redirect output into a file (using standard output <code>&gt;</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>ls -la &gt; listoutputfile.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>If there is an error, you can write out the error to a file using the standard error output <code>2&gt;</code>;</p>\n<pre><code>ls -la not.here 2&gt; lserror.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>I used to use the &gt; when backing up a MySQL database without really understanding what it was:</p>\n<pre><code>mysqldump --opt -u root -p mydatabase &gt; mbackupfile.sql\n</code></pre>\n<p>To redirect output as input to another script use the pipe <code>|</code>. For example, to get a list of files (recursive) in a directory you can use <code>find</code> and then pipe it into <code>wc</code> which stands for word count:</p>\n<pre><code>find . -type f | wc -l\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"runningscripts\">Running scripts</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to run your script is to run from it's directory using the bash command:</p>\n<pre><code>bash ./myscript\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want your script to be available on your system, you can either add it to the $PATH or you can move it to <code>/usr/local/bin</code></p>\n<p>To turn your script into an executable run:</p>\n<pre><code>chmod +x myscript\n</code></pre>\n<p>And run it with:</p>\n<pre><code>./myscript\n</code></pre>\n<p>More on Unix permissions can be found at <a href=\"http://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php\">linuxcommand.org</a>.</p>\n<p>If you try to run it with just <code>myscript</code> you will get a 'command not found' error. This is because bash will look in the <code>/usr/local/bin</code> for the executable, hence we have to explicitly say that the script is here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bashrcrefreshreload\">.bashrc refresh/reload</h2>\n<p>If you edit your .bashrc file and you want to apply those changes without logging off and back on again just run:</p>\n<pre><code>. ~/.bashrc\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>source ~/.bashrc\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bash scripting is really powerful.

Or sometimes, when I've been conkers deep in Elasticsearch or CSS or some other seemingly random task I end up with, and a simple question comes my way and I'm hit with a complete blank. And it's a question I knew! Stupid brain as homer would say. Anyways, this is a list of refreshers more than anything for interviews I may do.</p>\n<p>I'm going to start with the basics, then work up to more advanced stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usestrict\">use strict</h2>\n<p>What does the 'use strict' directive do? It tells the compiler/interpreter to utilise the strict variant of the ECMAScript when parsing. This spots global variables, prevents 'this' coercion, disallows duplicate property names.</p>\n<h2 id=\"null\">Null</h2>\n<p>There is a bug in the language at the moment with null. Null should be null, but it isn't, it is an object.</p>\n<pre><code>var bar = null;\ntypeof bar === 'object' //true\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"declaredvariablesundeclaredandundefined\">Declared variables, undeclared, and undefined</h2>\n<pre><code>x === undefined //throws a reference error 'x is not defined'\nlet x;\nx === undefined //true\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"truthyandfalsystuff\">Truthy and Falsy stuff</h2>\n<p>A function is an object, objects are evaluated to true:</p>\n<pre><code>!!function f(){} === true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Usually you get some questions about the <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> operators. <code>===</code> is a lot faster because the <code>==</code> operator runs code to cast the type and then check values. Like &quot;1&quot; <code>==</code> 1 returns <code>true</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>1 === 1; //O(1)\n&quot;1&quot; == 1'; //O(n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"returnstatement\">Return statement</h2>\n<p>Crockford is great. His example of the return statement issues in javascript is classic. Javascript as automatic semicolon insertion, so the below would return <code>undefined</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>return \n{\n  name: 'Billy Bob'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"numberquirks\">Number quirks</h2>\n<p>Because javascript uses the <a href=\"http://www.2ality.com/2012/04/number-encoding.html\">IEE754 standard</a>, and numbers with computers are not great - in fact there is mathematical theory that numbers are constantly changing. But anyway, you have to be careful when it comes to numbers. A common question is something like this, will the below be true or false:</p>\n<pre><code>(0.033 + 0.0312) === 0.0642\n</code></pre>\n<p>It would be false, because the result would be:</p>\n<pre><code>0.06420000000000001\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codementor.io/javascript/tutorial/21-essential-javascript-tech-interview-practice-questions-answers\">Codementor 21 essential interview practice questions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions\">Toptal javascript interview questions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95#.g822zmfgh\">Medium - 10 interview questions every javascript engineer should know</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3#.8yfwzitii\">Medium - the two pillars of javascript</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Like an absolute path and file name, but it goes right to left.

A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.

Because it is a cloud we don't really have static IP addresses, instead they are dynamically assigned. Things could fail, increased usage means new instances pop up, decreased usage could mean removing instances. The only constant is change.</p>\n<p>Therefore, a service should have a way of discovering dependencies, wait for dependencies to become available, and not fail if a dependency fails or disappears.</p>\n<p>So how do we keep a tally of what is where? <strong>Discovery mechanisms</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.consul.io/\">Consul.io</a> or Nginx plus for example.

For example, we need a list of all these services to be available, a database, a 'registry service'. The client queries this service registry, gets a list of network locations, uses some algorithm for load balancing to select which service to use.</p>\n<p>When a service instance starts up it registers itself with the service registry, and also when it terminates. The registry itself uses a heartbeat mechanism to detect services that are up, ones that aren't are removed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"serversidediscoverypattern\">Server side discovery pattern</h2>\n<p>You still have a service registry in this pattern, but the difference is it is behind a load balancer (Squid for example, or Amazon's ELB). The load balancer queries the registry, gets the network address, and then uses that service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n<p>There are lots of tools out there that solve the above.

The '::' means 'has type'. The return value of the function comes after the comma, and the '-&gt;' is a function with its returning value. So this notation:</p>\n<pre><code>f :: number -&gt; number\n</code></pre>\n<p>Becomes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const add10 = (x) =&gt; x + 10;\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"higherorderfunctions\">Higher order functions</h2>\n<p>Functions are essentially objects, first class citizens, and can move around as such. Hence we have 'higher order' functions - functions that take other functions as parameters and/or return functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arity\">Arity</h2>\n<p>It is best practice that the number of parameters a function takes needs to be a maximum of two. A function really should do one thing and one thing only. Imagine how many branches there would be if a function got 3, 4, 5 or more parameters? That could indicate a complex function - not good.</p>\n<p>Functions should do one thing and one thing only. They should not modify anything other than in its own scope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closure\">Closure</h2>\n<p>The definition of a closure is 'a function object that has a reference to the variables in the context it was created in'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mutability\">Mutability</h2>\n<p>Functions should be pure. This could lead to problems when parameters are references to an object. If that object is changed within a function then a side effect results. Not good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"monads\">Monads</h2>\n<p>A monad is an object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functionsinthefunkerexample\">Functions in the 'funker' example</h2>\n<h3 id=\"filter\">.filter</h3>\n<h3 id=\"get\">.get</h3>\n<p>So with imperative coding, to get an attribute for each object in an array we would have to write a for loop, then access the property. Then when we need to do it somewhere else we would write another for loop ...</p>\n<p>Not with higher order functions. We simply want to 'get' a property. So we can pass this to a map or forEach like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">[{ name: 'Billy', age: 42 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 24 }].map(funker.get('name'));\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"curry\">.curry</h3>\n<p>If you have ever used bind, then you are half way there. Currying is the same as bind, but applied in a different way. With bind a new function is returned with the 'this' parameter of the original function set to the first parameter of the bind function. This is partial application, and that is what currying is - partial application.</p>\n<p>Currying takes 1 function with n arguments, and converts it to n functions with 1 argument. We can then create a function that already has most of the data it needs held in a closure, and then we can reuse it.</p>\n<p>So instead of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);\n</code></pre>\n<p>it becomes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">add(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n</code></pre>\n<p>That looks a bit weird and not very useful. So to convert a function that usually takes multiple params:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let addToFifteen = funcker.curry(add, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nlet addToThirty = funcker.curry(add, 10, 10, 10);\nconsole.log(addToFifteen(15));  //30\nconsole.log(addToThirty(15));  //45\n</code></pre>\n"

Then <a href=\"https://ropsten.etherscan.io\">check the status</a>. You now should have an account and some Eth. Great.</p>\n<p>Your new account is called an EOA or Externally Owned Account (or Wallet). There is another type of account, called a Contract Account.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://kobl.one/blog/create-full-ethereum-keypair-and-address/\">create your own keypair address</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout | openssl ec -text -noout\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"transactions\">Transactions</h2>\n<p>Everything on a blockchain is a transaction. A transaction is a change of state. Transactions take time and energy, so they are paid using 'gas'. Viewing a transaction is not a transaction therefore does not cost any gas. The gas pays the miners for mining, as they do the hard work validating transactions. As energy is involved (cost) Ethereum has a currency called Eth. This value can be sent to a contract address or from person to person.</p>\n<p>These transactions are signed messages transmitted by the Ethereum network, then mined (recorded) on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>A transaction can have value and/or data or nothing. So value would be a payment, like you sending me 1 ETH. A data payload to a smart contract contains serialised hex encoding of a function name and parameters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"digitalsignature\">Digital signature</h2>\n<p>The essence of a digital signature is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you have a public and private key</li>\n<li>you have a message/document that needs signing</li>\n<li>you hash the document, and hash that using your private key</li>\n<li>the signature can be verified by using your public key to decrypt the hash, and the result will equal a hash of message/document</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How this works in Ethereum is the message in the transaction is hashed using your private key, and sent along with the message.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smartcontracts\">Smart contracts</h2>\n<p>A Smart Contract is a program that executes predefined actions when specific conditions are met. Most contracts are written in Solidity and compiled into assembly.</p>\n<p>A smart contract is created by sending a transaction with an empty 'to' field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soliditydevelopment\">Solidity development</h2>\n<p>Install:<br>\nnom install -g truffle ganache-cli<br>\nRun:<br>\nganache-cli<br>\nIn another terminal run:<br>\ntruffle develop<br>\nweb3.eth.accounts //list accounts<br>\nweb3.eth.coinbase // should be the same as the first account<br>\nweb3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.coinbase) // shows the ETH as WEI in BigNumber format</p>\n<h2 id=\"definitions\">Definitions</h2>\n<p>BigNumber -</p>\n<h2 id=\"writingsolidity\">Writing Solidity</h2>\n<p>To check the validity of something, like <code>assert</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>require([boolean conditions])\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/glossary.html#glossary-json-interface\">JSON interface</a> AKA <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI\">ABI</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"parity\">Parity</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@preitsma/setting-up-a-parity-ethereum-node-in-docker-and-connect-safely-f881faa17686\">https://medium.com/@preitsma/setting-up-a-parity-ethereum-node-in-docker-and-connect-safely-f881faa17686</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.parity.io/Configuring-Parity\">https://wiki.parity.io/Configuring-Parity</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"forks\">Forks</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html\">https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/short-guide-bitcoin-forks-explained/\">https://www.coindesk.com/short-guide-bitcoin-forks-explained/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"consensusalgorithms\">Consensus algorithms</h2>\n<p>Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) - Consensus algorithm used by Hyperledger Sawtooth that utilizes a lottery function in which the node with the shortest wait time creates the next block.</p>\n<p>Proof of Stake (PoS) - Consensus algorithm where nodes are randomly selected to validate blocks, and the probability of this random selection depends on the amount of stake held.</p>\n<p>Proof of Work (PoW) - Consensus algorithm first utilized by Bitcoin that involves solving a computational challenging puzzle in order to create a new block.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.wavesplatform.com/review-of-blockchain-consensus-mechanisms-f575afae38f2\">Overview</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use parity-solo instead of rinkeby/geth on dev</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make hub pick up contract address from file (see vodacoin-app)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deploy contract using inventrust-truffle docker container (see tests sections in website-logic Jenkinsfile)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write contract address to file during restart (see vodacoin-network Jenkinsfile)<br>\nIt might make sense to set up a separate staging environment (on Rinkeby) in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>let tokenRegistryAddress = process.env.TOKEN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS\nif (tokenRegistryAddress === undefined) {\ntokenRegistryAddress = fs.readFileSync('token_registry_address.txt').toString().trim()\n}\nlogger.info('Token registry address', tokenRegistryAddress)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"solidityandtruffle\">Solidity and Truffle</h2>\n<p>Start by installing and running <code>testrpc</code>.</p>\n<p>Run Ganache</p>\n<pre><code>truffle compile\ntruffle test\n</code></pre>\n<p>ethereumjs-testrpc</p>\n<pre><code>modifier modifierName([params]) {\n // ok or error\n}\n\nfunction functionName() [visibilitySpecifier] [modifiers] [returns (values)] {\n  //logic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A library and a smart contract.</p>\n<p>DAO - contract structure</p>\n<p>DApps</p>\n<p>New economies such as <a href=\"https://steemit.com/\">steemit</a></p>\n<p>rpc or ipc</p>\n<p>there are no null values in solidity<br>\nlarge numbers better stored as string</p>\n<p>storage types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>storage (in closure)</li>\n<li>locks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>locks cost less gas</p>\n<p>Example: Charity</p>\n<p>Use case:</p>\n<p>I want to donate to charity.

Instead, one or more trusted parties ('oracles') must create a transaction which embeds that data in the chain. This data is often gathered and stored in a traditional database by the oracle. Any interaction between a blockchain and the outside world is restricted to regular database operations.</p>\n<p>In other words, an oracle pushes data onto the blockchain, rather than a smart contract pulling it in. Once the oracle pushes the data, every node will have an identical copy of this data. This allows for the data to be safely used in a smart contract computation. While oracles allow for blockchain interface with external data, they undermine the goal of a decentralized system. Examine when such a trusted authority should be retained. When the trusted authority would or should be retained, efficiencies in the blockchain are not as high as in other applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gamifiedlearning\">Gamified learning</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/\">https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://cryptozombies.io/\">https://cryptozombies.io/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<p>-<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/blockchain-underpinnings-hashing-7f4746cbd66b\">Hashing</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity\">Remix online solidity editor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3.html\">web3.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/#version=soljson-v0.4.12+commit.194ff033.js\">Online compiler</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/\">docs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05\">Hitchikers guide to smart contracts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-is-blockchain-technology-similar-to-torrent-technology-How-is-it-different\">How blockchain is similar to torrents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://truffleframework.com/\">Truffle docco</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@gus_tavo_guim/testing-your-smart-contracts-with-javascript-40d4edc2abed\">Testing your truffle smart contracts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop\">Truffle first tutorial</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://truffleframework.com/ganache/\">Ganash</a> - a personal Ethereum blockchain to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://truffleframework.com/boxes/\">truffle box</a> - boilerplates that can contain other modules, Solidity contracts and libraries, front-end views, complete example dapps</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf\">Yellow paper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@codetractio/inside-an-ethereum-transaction-fa94ffca912f\">Inside an Ethereum transaction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/\">Learn x in y minutes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05\">Zeppelin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/hello-sugoi/ethereum-signing-and-validating-13a2d7cb0ee3\">Ethereum signing and validating</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI\">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/12/build-server-less-applications-mist/\">https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/12/build-server-less-applications-mist/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@merunasgrincalaitis/the-ultimate-end-to-end-tutorial-to-create-and-deploy-a-fully-descentralized-dapp-in-ethereum-18f0cf6d7e0e\">https://medium.com/@merunasgrincalaitis/the-ultimate-end-to-end-tutorial-to-create-and-deploy-a-fully-descentralized-dapp-in-ethereum-18f0cf6d7e0e</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ethereum.org/greeter\">https://www.ethereum.org/greeter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/0.8.0\">https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/0.8.0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coursetro.com/posts/code/99/Interacting-with-a-Smart-Contract-through-Web3.js-(Tutorial)\">https://coursetro.com/posts/code/99/Interacting-with-a-Smart-Contract-through-Web3.js-(Tutorial)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com/tutorials/javascript-api-1/\">https://dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com/tutorials/javascript-api-1/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://truffleframework.com/\">http://truffleframework.com/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/\">Learn x in y minutes</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-1-40d2d0d807c2\">DAPP tutorial</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-2-30b3d335aa1f\">Full stack hello world voting app</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/information/why-use-a-blockchain/\">Why use a blockchain?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://thecontrol.co/a-brief-overview-of-dapp-development-b8ac1648322c\">Overview of DAPP development</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://souptacular.gitbooks.io/ethereum-tutorials-and-tips-by-hudson/content/private-chain.html\">Create a private chain</a> with <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth\">Geth</a></p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm - A consensus algorithm designed to defend against failures in the system caused by forged or malicious messages. In order to be fault tolerant of a Byzantine fault, the number of nodes that must reach consensus is 2f+1 in a system containing 3f+1, where f is the number of faults in the system.</p>\n<p>Consensus Algorithm - Refers to a system of ensuring that parties agree to a certain state of the system as the true state.</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency - is a digital asset that is used as a medium of exchange. A cryptocurrency is exchanged by using digital signatures to transfer ownership from one cryptographic key pair to another key pair. Since this digital asset has characteristics of money (like store of value and medium of exchange), it is generally referred to as currency. Note: It should not be confused with digital currency or virtual currency.</p>\n<p>Cryptoeconomics - A field of study that explores the intersection of cryptography and economic incentives. While cryptography is used for ensuring network security at various levels and functions, the built-in economic incentives provided to the participating nodes in the network ensure that, at any given point, the majority of players in the network operate in a desirable way.</p>\n<p>Cryptography - The study of the techniques used to allow secure communication between different parties, and to ensure the authenticity and immutability of the data being communicated.</p>\n<p>Distributed Ledger - A type of data structure which resides across multiple computer devices, generally spread across locations and regions.</p>\n<p>Key/Value Pair - It consists of two parts, one designated as a 'key', and another as a 'value'. The 'key' is an identifier that allows you to look up the 'value'. The 'value' is the data that is stored for a given 'key'.</p>\n<p>Private/Public Keys - Private keys are used to derive a public key. While private keys remain confidential, public keys are available to everyone in the network (similar to an email address). Anything encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted using its corresponding private key, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>State - Contains up-to-date data that represents the latest values for all keys included in the network's ledger. The state of a network encompasses all past transactions in the network, from the genesis block to the present time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/\">https://etherscan.io/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-does-Ethereum-verify-contract-execution\">https://www.quora.com/How-does-Ethereum-verify-contract-execution</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-gas-fuel-and-fees-3333e17fe1dc\">https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-gas-fuel-and-fees-3333e17fe1dc</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethgasstation.info/\">https://ethgasstation.info/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369\">https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethstats.net/\">https://ethstats.net/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m89CVujrQe5LAFJ8-YAUCcNK950dUzMQPMJBxRtGCqs/edit#gid=0\">Gas price spreadsheet</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ethviewer.live/\">Mining visualisation</a></li>\n<li>mining <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining\">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/07/on-public-and-private-blockchains/\">Public and private</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol\">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/https-medium-com-zubairnahmed-react-ethereum-getting-started-with-the-minimum-toolset-required-part-1-of-4-9562efa23d18\">https://levelup.gitconnected.com/https-medium-com-zubairnahmed-react-ethereum-getting-started-with-the-minimum-toolset-required-part-1-of-4-9562efa23d18</a></p>\n"

Otherwise you could go on and on flipping through pages and pages in some sort of dull stupor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thethingymajigyouknow\">The thingymajig, you know?</h2>\n<p>Communication comes from the latin word 'to share'. The concept should stay exactly as it was from the originator, passing to the communicate-ee. The person receiving the concept may well describe it completely differently when they communicate it to another, but the concept should be exactly the same. When learning we want the concept to pass from the author to our, dare I say, 'psyche'. The person sharing and the person learning each have their own particular education, upbringing, and dare I say 'conditioning'. Therefore sometimes things can get lost in communication. Ideally we all want to be singing from the same hymn sheet, 'fa lala la laa'. Therefore all of our terms need to be clearly defined. If we have definitions understood for every term, from the educator to the learner, then the concept should slip from A to B easily and be exactly the same concept in both parties.</p>\n<h2 id=\"someconceptsaremoreequalthanothers\">Some concepts are more equal than others</h2>\n<p>In a sprawling web of data it is easy to think that each bit is of equal importance to the rest. This is incorrect, and something I see far too often. Tutorials go on and on and demonstrate each thing as important to the other. In fact, it happens in technical interviews too. They give you some edge case code to look at. Do they really think that is equally important to everything else in the subject? Worrisome. This then means a subject has core principles or concepts, and like a mind map or graph data structure have other, less important concepts related.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iaintgottimetobleed\">I ain't got time to bleed</h2>\n<p>So, time is a precious commodity, so you have to have certain boundaries. Well, what I mean is it is economical to get a seriously high percentage of gain from the shortest length of time.</p>\n<p>I am an advocate of speed reading. I wonder how much is comprehended if each word, sentence, paragraph is given time to. By the end of the page how much time/comprehension has been had? Why not speed read and the time/comprehension ration would be a lot better. Clean up the sticking points. Blast through and stay enthused.</p>\n<p>The upshot is, figure out what you want to get out of something. Make sure the core concepts are nailed - make sure definitions are learned so you know what someone is banging on about. Spend time wisely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoyougettocarnegiehall\">How do you get to Carnegie hall?</h2>\n<p>Study is one thing. In quite abstract subjects like programming it is hard to get substance.

The cypher algorithm usually takes a key as a parameter. The decryption will take the cypher text and convert it back to the original message.</p>\n<p>An analogy for encryption/decryption is the lock and key. Whatever the lock protects is the secret. We may know the inner workings of the lock generally, but we must have the right key so we can get in and prevent others from getting in. The lock can be opened or closed using the key - this is enciphering (encoding) and deciphering (decoding). The lock would be the cypher, and the key is, well, the key. The secret would be the opened door, the closed door would be the cyphertext.</p>\n<h2 id=\"codes\">Codes</h2>\n<p>A code is like a puzzle, it just takes time to solve it. No system is 100% foolproof. Time is a factor in many ways. How clever/complicated a code is to crack means it will take years for a normal computer hack. Also, for a code to be useful in encoding/decoding it needs to be a useful speed. For example, logging into a website does not have to be instantaneous (this makes things tougher for a brute force attack) but also needs to be fast enough for the user to not be perturbed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"symmetriccipher\">Symmetric Cipher</h2>\n<p>Symmetric as in 'exactly similar parts facing each other'. So basically the cipher for input is the opposite of the cypher for output. A simple example could be a 'substitution cipher', where characters are substituted:</p>\n<pre><code>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n</code></pre>\n<p>The key:</p>\n<pre><code>w g m u p b l y a r i q v k f n d t c o x e z j s h\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const key = { a: 'w', b: 'g', c: 'm', d: 'u', e: 'p', f: 'b', g: 'l', h: 'y', i: 'a', j: 'r', k: 'i', l: 'q', m: 'v', n: 'k', o: 'f', p: 'n', q: 'd', r: 't', s: 'c', t: 'o', u: 'x', v: 'e', w: 'z', x: 'j', y: 's', z: 'h', };\n\nconst decodeKey = (() =&gt; Object.keys(key).reduce((curr, next) =&gt; {\n    curr[key[next]] = next;\n    return curr;\n  }, {}))();\n\nfunction encipher(plaintext) {\n  return plaintext.split('').map(char =&gt; key[char] || '*').join('');\n}\n\nfunction decipher(plaintext) {\n  return plaintext.split('').map(char =&gt; decodeKey[char] || ' ').join('');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So using the key to cipher the 'plaintext' string 'i am a little teapot' would return <code>a*wv*w*qaooqp*opwnfo</code>. As you can see, they key is the thing used to encode/decode a message. You can see the problem with this method though - both parties need to have the same key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asymmetriccipher\">Asymmetric Cipher</h2>\n<p>The asymmetric cypher has two keys - private and public. The private key is used to encode, the public key is used to decode. This makes transfer from one party to another possible. Alice wants to send a message to Bob without anyone seeing. Alice has a private and public key, as does Bob. Alice uses Bob's public key and encrypts a message using it. Alice cannot decrypt that message even though she is the one who encrypted it. Bob gets a cipher, he uses his private key to decrypt it. He reads the message. Taking our simple substitution cypher we can create an asymmetric cypher:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'];\n\n// as a user, generate a public/private key pair\nfunction generate () {\n  \n  const privateKey = {};\n  const publicKey = {};\n\n  const privateSource = letters.slice();\n  const publicSource = letters.slice();\n\n  let index = 0;\n\n  while (privateSource.length &gt; 0) {\n    const privateIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * privateSource.length);\n    const privateLetter = privateSource.splice(privateIndex, 1);\n\n    const publicIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * publicSource.length);\n    const publicLetter = publicSource.splice(publicIndex, 1);\n\n    publicKey[letters[index]] = publicLetter[0];\n    privateKey[publicLetter[0]] = letters[index];\n    index++;\n  }\n\n  return {\n    privateKey,\n    publicKey,\n  };\n}\n\nfunction encode (message, key) {\n  let result = '';\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; message.length; i++) {\n    result += key[message[i]] || '*';\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\nfunction decode(message, key) {\n  return encode(message, key).replace(/\\*/g, ' ');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we can create two users:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const alice = generate();\nconst bob = generate();\n</code></pre>\n<p>And a discussion would go like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// alice encodes a message with bobs public key\nconst aliceToBobMessage = 'hello bob i like cheese';\nconst aliceCodeFromBobPublicKey = encode(aliceToBobMessage, bob.publicKey);\nconsole.log(aliceCodeFromBobPublicKey); // kjzzq*yqy*a*zaej*lkjjbj\n\nconst bobDecodeFromAliceWithPrivateKey = decode(aliceCodeFromBobPublicKey, bob.privateKey);\nconsole.log(bobDecodeFromAliceWithPrivateKey); // hello bob i like cheese\n\n// alice cannot decode using her private key\nconsole.log(decode(aliceCodeFromBobPublicKey, alice.privateKey)); //cbkkg mgm q kqrb zcbbob\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we can see that bob is the only one who can decrypt the message encrypted with his public key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eorexclusiveor\">EOR - Exclusive OR</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed from the above that we have a message that gets encrypted, then decrypted. Essentially what we have is a number of bits that get 'flipped' from one state to another. This is where the EOR operator comes in.</p>\n<p>Truth table:</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><b>A</b></th>\n      <th><b>B</b></th>\n      <th><b>Output</b></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"otherexamples\">Other examples</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"asymmetric-cryptographyhttp://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/asymmetric-cryptography\">Asymmetric cryptography definition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://coolaj86.com/articles/asymmetric-public--private-key-encryption-in-node-js/\">Asymmetric public/private key encryption in node.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coolaj86/examples-rsa-keypairs/blob/master/rsa-keypairgen.js\">RSA keypairgen</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"libraries\">Libraries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge\">Node forge</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector\">Initialisation vector</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Advanced-Encryption-Standard\">AES encryption</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/secret-key-algorithm\">Synchronous encryption</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/10/implement-aes-strength-encryption-javascript/\">AES with source-forge tutorial</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wesecure.net/learn/\">The Crypto Academy</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

I've created an <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/koa-api\">example api</a> as I like to learn by doing.</p>\n<p>At first glance it is very similar to Express through the use of middleware. My setup for this type of thing is:</p>\n<pre><code>/server.js\n/lib/app.js\n/lib/middleware.js\n/lib/router.js\n/lib/...\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"serverjs\">server.js</h3>\n<p>This literally starts the server:</p>\n<pre><code>\nrequire('./lib/app').listen(process.env.PORT);\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"appjs\">app.js</h3>\n<pre><code>const Koa = require('koa');\nconst app = new Koa();\nrequire('./middleware')(app);\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"middlewarejs\">middleware.js</h3>\n<p>This is the main link between the app and the functionality. I like to have my middleware in one place. This is the lynchpin for the router too.</p>\n<pre><code>const helmet = require('koa-helmet');\nconst router = require('./router');\n\nconst middleware = (app) =&gt; {\n\n  app.use(helmet());\n\n  app.use(async (ctx, next) =&gt; {\n    const start = Date.now();\n    await next();\n    const ms = Date.now() - start;\n    ctx.set('X-Response-Time', `${ms}ms`);\n  });\n\n  app.use(async (ctx, next) =&gt; {\n    const start = Date.now();\n    await next();\n    const ms = Date.now() - start;\n    console.log(`${ctx.method} ${ctx.url} - ${ms}`);\n  });\n\n  app\n    .use(router.routes())\n    .use(router.allowedMethods());\n\n} \n\nmodule.exports = middleware;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"routerjs\">router.js</h3>\n<p>The think about Koa is that it is quite minimal. You have to add the components you need, in this case a router. Also like the built in router of express, you can attach routers to each other. I like to have a main router file that pulls in other routes, so depending on your use case you can modularise the logic and pull them in through a router.</p>\n<pre><code>\nconst Router = require('koa-router');\nconst router = new Router();\n\nrouter.get('/', (ctx, next) =&gt; {\n  ctx.body = 'Hello World';\n  next();\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"tests\">Tests</h3>\n<p>Testing as usual</p>\n<pre><code>const app = require('../app');\nconst request = require('supertest');\n\ndescribe('router: index', () =&gt; {\n  test('should respond with hello world', async () =&gt; {\n    const response = await request(app.listen()).get('/');\n    expect(response.status).toEqual(200);\n    expect(response.text).toEqual('Hello World');\n  });\n});\n</code></pre>\n"

[Qm] - two bytes Q is the function code, the m is the digest length (e.g the length of the rest of the hash). This is called a <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/multihash\">multihash</a>. SO 'Q' is the SHA-256 algorithm and 'm' means a length of 32 bytes.</p>\n<p>But thats not all. The hash is encoded using base58.</p>\n<h2 id=\"base58\">Base 58</h2>\n<p>Like <a href=\"/2015/08/18/base64/\">base64</a> but doesn't use any non-alphanumeric characters. Why? Because it is intended for humans. Similar looking letters are also removed, such as 0/O, I/l. So this format is used on IPFS hashes as well as Bitcoin et al.</p>\n<p>Ok, so what is my point? Well, Say we want to store this hash in Solidity using 32 bytes. You can see we have an extra couple of bytes. In current builds, IPFS use 'Qm'. It depends on the protocol used for encryption, so beware, it may not always be 'Qm'.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs58\">bs58</a> we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>decode the base58</li>\n<li>remove the prefixed two bytes</li>\n<li>convert to hex</li>\n<li>reverse the process</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My first crack at the decode function was this:</p>\n<pre><code>'Qm' + bs58.encode(Buffer.from(short.slice(2), 'hex'))\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the 'Qm' part is incorrect. The actual way to do it is prefix with hex '1220', then encode:</p>\n<pre><code>const shorten = (hash) =&gt; '0x' + bs58.decode(hash).slice(2).toString('hex')\n\nconst lengthen = (short) =&gt; bs58.encode(Buffer.from('1220' + short.slice(2), 'hex'))\n</code></pre>\n<p>So in this way we can store and recreate hashes in Solidity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/multihash\">multiformats/multihash</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/why-do-ipfs-hashes-start-with-qm/477/7\">Why do ipfs hashes start with Qm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58\">Base58</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/52727/byte-array-to-hexadecimal-and-back-again-in-javascript\">Byte array to hexadecimal and back again</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

If you do, the <code>config.yaml</code> file is where you do it.</p>\n<p>There are seven primary sections, representing steps in the build/test/deploy process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[docker, machine, and macos] executor environments\n<ul>\n<li>machine - Virtual Machine executor and settings e.g. time zone<br>\n-- environment - environment variables e.g <code>foo: bar</code></li>\n<li>docker</li>\n<li>macos</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>checkout - e.g. <code>git clone</code></li>\n<li>dependencies - e.g. <code>npm install</code></li>\n<li>database - prepare a database for tests. Default include Postgres, MySQL, Redis</li>\n<li>compile - compile your project</li>\n<li>test - run your tests\n<ul>\n<li><code>override</code>, <code>pre</code>, <code>post</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>deployment -</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each step in the above is run in its own context, so if you want an environment variables persisted you need to set that up in the <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Contexts</code> section. For SSH keys you can add in <code>Project Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Permissions</code> -&gt; <code>SSH keys</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"test\">Test</h2>\n<p>By default these directories are used: <code>test/unit</code>, <code>test/integration</code>, and <code>test/functional</code>. With node I usually have test folders in each module/lib in my app. I would say for unit testing, use <code>**/*.spec.js</code>, for integration put in <code>/test/integration</code>. The test locations can be overridden by:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">test:\n  minitest_globs:\n    - test/integration/**/*.test.js\n    - **/*.spec.js\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deployment\">Deployment</h2>\n<p>If a test is green, the next (optional) step is deployment. The names below (production, staging, dev) relate to the current branch. You can also deploy based on tags.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">deployment:\n  production:\n    branch: production\n    commands:\n      - ./deploy_prod.sh\n  staging:\n    branch: master\n    commands:\n      - ./deploy_staging.sh\n  dev:\n    branch: dev\n    commands:\n      - ./deploy_dev.sh\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"testinglocally\">Testing locally</h2>\n<p>You can install the circle.ci CLI tool using:</p>\n<pre><code>curl -o /usr/local/bin/circleci https://circle-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/build_agent_wrapper/circleci &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/circleci\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then run <code>circleci config validate -c .circleci/config.yaml</code> to validate your config file. Or <code>circleci build</code> to execute your build step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exampleconfig\">Example config</h2>\n<p>First we need to specify the latest version, which is 2.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">version: 2\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">jobs: \n  build:\n    docker:\n      - image: circleci/node:9.9.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first image is the primary image - where you will reference. After which you can specify dependency Docker images, if any. CircleCI maintains a library of <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/\">pre-built images</a> so you can target them directly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">    working_directory: ~/repo\n\n    steps:\n      - checkout\n\n      # Download and cache dependencies\n      - restore_cache:\n          keys:\n          - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum &quot;package.json&quot; }}\n          # fallback to using the latest cache if no exact match is found\n          - v1-dependencies-\n\n      - run: yarn install\n\n      - save_cache:\n          paths:\n            - node_modules\n          key: v1-dependencies-{{ checksum &quot;package.json&quot; }}\n        \n      # run tests!\n      - run: yarn test\n</code></pre>\n"

The '::' means 'has type'. The return value of the function comes after the comma, and the '-&gt;' is a function with its returning value. So this notation:</p>\n<pre><code>f :: number -&gt; number\n</code></pre>\n<p>Becomes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const add10 = (x) =&gt; x + 10;\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"higherorderfunctions\">Higher order functions</h2>\n<p>Functions are essentially objects, first class citizens, and can move around as such. Hence we have 'higher order' functions - functions that take other functions as parameters and/or return functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arity\">Arity</h2>\n<p>It is best practice that the number of parameters a function takes needs to be a maximum of two. A function really should do one thing and one thing only. Imagine how many branches there would be if a function got 3, 4, 5 or more parameters? That could indicate a complex function - not good.</p>\n<p>Functions should do one thing and one thing only. They should not modify anything other than in its own scope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closure\">Closure</h2>\n<p>The definition of a closure is 'a function object that has a reference to the variables in the context it was created in'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mutability\">Mutability</h2>\n<p>Functions should be pure. This could lead to problems when parameters are references to an object. If that object is changed within a function then a side effect results. Not good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"monads\">Monads</h2>\n<p>A monad is an object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functionsinthefunkerexample\">Functions in the 'funker' example</h2>\n<h3 id=\"curry\">.curry</h3>\n<p>If you have ever used bind, then you are half way there. Currying is the same as bind, but applied in a different way. With bind a new function is returned with the 'this' parameter of the original function set to the first parameter of the bind function. Other parameters are partially applied, using closure. The partial application part is exactly what currying is.</p>\n<p>Currying takes 1 function with n arguments, and converts it to n functions with 1 argument. We can then create a function that already has most of the data it needs held in a closure, and then we can reuse it.</p>\n<p>So instead of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);\n</code></pre>\n<p>it becomes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">add(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n</code></pre>\n<p>That looks a bit weird and not very useful. So to convert a function that usually takes multiple params:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let addToFifteen = funcker.curry(add, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nlet addToThirty = funcker.curry(add, 10, 10, 10);\nconsole.log(addToFifteen(15));  //30\nconsole.log(addToThirty(15));  //45\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"filter\">.filter</h3>\n<p>Curried Array.filter</p>\n<h3 id=\"get\">.get</h3>\n<p>So with imperative coding, to get an attribute for each object in an array we would have to write a for loop, then access the property. Then when we need to do it somewhere else we would write another for loop ...</p>\n<p>Not with higher order functions. We simply want to 'get' a property. So we can pass this to a map or forEach like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">[{ name: 'Billy', age: 42 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 24 }].map(funker.get('name'));\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"only\">.only</h3>\n<p>Get a new object with only the fields specified in a space delimited string.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const getNameAge = only('name age');\nconst userObject = { name: 'Tad', age: 40, secret: 'shhh, don\\'t tell anyone' };\nconsole.log(getNameAge(userObject)); // { name: 'Tad', age: 40 }\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"compose\">.compose</h3>\n<p>Function composition: s: f1 =&gt; f2 =&gt; f3 =&gt; f1(f2(f3(s)))</p>\n<p>Takes an array of functions and applies them in reverse order to the supplied value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">compose([f1, f2, f3], value) =&gt; f1(f2(f3(value)))\n</code></pre>\n"

When you lie you create a dichotomy - truth and lie - therefore a split in the psyche</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n<p>A ledger is a book containing records of transactions. It started off blank. In the case of a Bank it also started with an empty vault. As people created accounts and deposited money, the ledger recorded these balances and transactions. The bank owned the ledger. Banks accumulated a lot of gold and money in their vaults. Just sitting there, all this wealth wasn’t doing much, besides, when people transferred money to each other at the same bank, the money didn’t move, only the ledger would change.</p>\n<p>The banks got an idea, all this money in our vaults and people aren’t doing anything with it. They thought they could lend a percentage of the money out to people, charge interest on these loans, and told the existing customers they could share in the profit by earning interest on their savings.</p>\n<p>So, if interest is charged on borrowers, how could you get money out of thin air? Think about it. Say there is a total of one million pounds in existence. Billy borrows 10K, at 10% interest. That means 1K in money needs to be created in order to pay the debt. This means extra money needs to be printed. It also means more money would be in circulation, so existing money would be worth less than it was before. This leads to inflation. Debt is a vacuum. Inflation is offset by production. If you are a farmer you are creating food from resources such as the sun, air, water etc. Nature keeps giving. You also buy things, use them, throw them away. That is a loss. So ecconomics is the production, circulation, and destruction of wealth. A continuum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"statusquo\">Status Quo</h2>\n<p>So what? Whats the point? Aren’t our systems today fine? Well, are they? I mean, they appear to work because we have a decent lifestyle ... most of us. First lets take money. We think it is ‘real’. But it is just a pice of paper, backed by a confidence in a system, that will be exchangeable for goods or services. But that is just confidence.</p>\n<p>Banks rule the world. That is not good. How do they rule? They print the money and they have the ledger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blockchain\">Blockchain</h2>\n<p>We have the ledger. Any of us can have the ledger. This brings problems - what if some individual or group wants to change the ledger for their benefit. This is only possible if they have control over 50% of all ledgers. This is the consensus part, all ledgers are in communication with each other and agree on transactions. As there are a lot of transactions they are grouped together, in order, into a 'block'. Think of this block as a page in a book ledger. The book has a unique page number, and you know the previous book number, so nothing can be inserted in between or removed. This is how blocks are 'chained' together.</p>\n<p>Blockchain is not one single technology. It is composed of quite a few. One is peer-to-peer, where computers (or nodes) are in communication with other nodes (as opposed to client-server architecture). To verify that nothing on the ledger changes a hashing technology is used. To ensure that it is you that is doing the transactions encryption and public/private digital signatures are used.</p>\n<p>This is a complete and utterly basic description! Next, a deep dive into distributed ledger technologies, the underpinning technologies and data structures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking\">Khan Academy finance, money and banking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://anders.com/blockchain/\">Anders blockchain example</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>A lot of teams are at least investigating GoLang. I love Node but started learning GoLang because the last place I worked had some apps written with it. I also started learning out of curiosity. I created <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/learning-go\">a github repo with some examples</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"learninggolang\">Learning GoLang</h1>\n<p>You usually have to start with a <a href=\"/01-hello/hello.go\">hello world</a>. But the best way to learn programming is with <a href=\"/00-testing/first_test.go\">TDD</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup\">Setup</h2>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/install\">install go</a> and then setup your <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH\">Go path</a>.</p>\n<p>Lets test the setup by creating a folder called <code>$GOPATH/src/learning</code>. Paste the below into a file called <code>hello.go</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">package main\n\nimport &quot;fmt&quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Printf(&quot;hello, world\\n&quot;)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To execute use <code>go run hello.go</code>.</p>\n<p>Go is also compiled into an executable. To do so run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd learning\ngo build hello.go // this creates the hello executable\n./hello\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>package main</code> tells GoLang that this is an executable file and not a library. An executable file must also have a <code>func main()</code>. If it is named something other than <code>main</code> that would be a library.</p>\n<p>The <code>fmt</code> is a package that handles input/output, in this case printing to stdout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"offlinego\">Offline Go</h2>\n<p>If you have go installed, run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">godoc -http=:6060\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then open to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:6060/\">http://127.0.0.1:6060/</a> in your browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"packageslibraries\">Packages/Libraries</h2>\n<p>A package, or library, groups together code which is utilised by another program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"types\">Types</h2>\n<p>Strongly typed language.</p>\n<p><code>bool</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float64</code></p>\n<p>Go word size is the memory address size. Based on your machine, 32bit, 64bit etc. An integer is based on your word size, so on a 64bit machine it will be 64 bits long, 32bits on a 32 bit machine.</p>\n<p>Go zero values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nil</li>\n<li>0</li>\n<li>false</li>\n<li>“”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"testingandtdd\">Testing and TDD</h2>\n<p>Testing, like a lot of languages, is included in GoLang.</p>\n<p>To run a test:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">go test --cover\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"variables\">Variables</h2>\n<p>Variable names. I can't beleive I have to mention this. Reading a lot of peoples interpretations of <a href=\"http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle\">pikestyle</a> reinforces my opinion of the human race. Oh yeah, you commute on the London tube every day for years and lets hear your opnion. Anyway, I digress. Pike clearly mentions 'clarity of expression'. The variable should describe exactly what it is. Our conventions for i in for loops is totally fine. Anyone who has programmed will know this one. That doesn't mean to say that all variables should be single letters does it? Code is written for humans. Beautiful code should read like well written prose.</p>\n<p>You can do multiple assignment:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-golang\">a, b, c := 10, 100, 1000\nfmt.Println(a, b, c)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"arraysandslices\">Arrays and Slices</h2>\n<p>So Go does a lot of things for you. For this example we want to demonstrate arrays and slices. So lets have seperate files for this. Oh, so how do you import these files then? Aahhh, you don't have to do anything. Well, apart from change the run command to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">go run main.go array.go slice.go\ngo build main.go array.go slice.go\n</code></pre>\n<p>The run command needs to group all these files into an executable.</p>\n<p>Rarely use arrays directly as they are pretty inflexible. Use slices instead. Of course arrays have their uses.</p>\n<p>You will see the reserved word 'make'. This function takes care of allocating memory for the slice in this example.</p>\n<p><code>make</code> does a few things, one is creating a channel, takes care of allocating memory for a slice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functions\">Functions</h2>\n<p>func [name]([[paramName/s,] type]) [[[name]return type], {(return types,)] {<br>\n...<br>\n}</p>\n<p>Functions beginning with a capital letter are exported. 'Fat', 'Println' etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"structs\">Structs</h2>\n<p>A struct is a custom type, which is an aggregate of other types.</p>\n<p>In structs, always have attributes listed from shortest length of the data type. int8, int16 etc as go pads out the structure with memory allocation based on the first longest?</p>\n<h2 id=\"pointers\">Pointers</h2>\n<p>Go is pass by value. To pass by reference you need to use pointers in the calling function parameter (*) and use 'address of' in the callee function parameters and body (&amp;) &amp;[variable name] i.e. &amp;count.</p>\n<p>pointers/pointer.go</p>\n<h2 id=\"goroutines\">Go routines</h2>\n<p>All Go you write gets run on a goroutine - an OS thread.</p>\n<h2 id=\"channels\">Channels</h2>\n<p>Channels are pipes that connect concurrent goroutines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"httpserver\">HTTP Server</h2>\n<p>http-server/server.go</p>\n<h2 id=\"pipes\">Pipes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://golang.org/src/io/pipe.go\">Golang pipes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zupzup.org/io-pipe-go/\">Zup Zup pipes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"timeandtickers\">Time and Tickers</h2>\n<p>http-json/http-json.go</p>\n<h2 id=\"commandline\">Command Line</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gobyexample.com/command-line-flags\">Go by example - flags</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"raceconditions\">Race Conditions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2018/02/18/golang-data-race-and-how-to-fix-it/\">GoLang data race and how to fix it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alco/gostart\">Go Start</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/\">Glang writing unit tests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/code.html\">How to write Go code</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gobyexample.com/\">Go by example</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests\">Learn go with tests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tour.golang.org/list\">GoLang tour</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rakyll.org/\">Awesome GoLang information from rakyll.org!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/golang-tdd/read\">TDD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://astaxie.gitbooks.io/build-web-application-with-golang/en/\">Web apps with GoLang</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://talks.golang.org/2012/10things.slide#8\">GoLang talks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackmongo.com/post/thinking-in-go/\">Thinking in Go</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/videos/ultimate-go-programming/9780134757476/9780134757476-ugpg_02_02_03_02\">Ultimate Go programming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://programming.guide/go/three-dots-ellipsis.html\">Programming guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/\">research.swtch.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://golangbot.com\">golangbot.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

A simple definition is 'a distributed ledger'. A ledger is a collection of financial accounts. Distributed means the exact copy exists in multiple places. But what does this mean? How does it work?</p>\n<p>Blockchain is a combination of existing and new technolgies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peer-to-peer</li>\n<li>Database and data structures (ledger)</li>\n<li>Cryptography</li>\n<li>Specific blockchain protocol (Bitcoin, Ethereum, et al)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"peertopeer\">Peer to peer</h2>\n<p>A peer to peer network consists of nodes. A node is a computer running specific software on a network, communicating to other nodes.</p>\n<p>But isnt't that just a server? The terminology is different because a node is not a stand alone server, it works along side others, so the client server paradigm doesn't quite match.</p>\n<p>Not all nodes are the same, some are full nodes (have the full blockchain database), some are light nodes (do not have the full database), a miner has a full node, unless it is mining through a mining pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ledger\">Ledger</h2>\n<p>A ledger is simply a record of accounts; a running record of transactions. These records are stored in a database such as Berkeley db or Leveldb.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transactions\">Transactions</h2>\n<p>What gets stored in the ledger? Transactions. I want to pay Bob 157 Satoshis. I need to have my address/account, Bob's address/account, how much I want to pay, plus my signature (traditionally a signature, with blockchain it is a digital signature).</p>\n<h2 id=\"cryptographichash\">Cryptographic hash</h2>\n<p>A hash algorithm takes in content and returns a fixed length string.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The resultant hash should be a fixed length</li>\n<li>It should be impossible to reverse</li>\n<li>It should be fast to verify</li>\n<li>A tiny change results in a vastly different hash</li>\n<li>Two different inputs should not result with the same hash</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The five items above comprise the attributes of a hashing function.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transactionsaddressesandsignatures\">Transactions, addresses and signatures</h2>\n<p>In order to make transactions you need an address. In traditional terms, an address for another to send you funds would be a bank account number. An address is really a public key. A public key has a counterpart; a private key. The private key is the proof of ownership of the address - if you have the private key you own everything.</p>\n<pre><code>[my address] =&gt; [recipient address] [amount] [fee] [signature]\n</code></pre>\n<p>What prevents a fraudulent transaction? That is what the signature is for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hash the <code>[my address] =&gt; [recipient address] [amount] [fee]</code></li>\n<li>Take that hash, and encrypt it with your private key, creating a signature</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your signature can only be decrypted using your public key. This is how a transaction can be verified in order for it to be included in the block.</p>\n<p>Digital Signatures are an important part, not just for the authentication of a transaction, but it could be used in an actual contract. Imagine you have a document to sign, an actual document, a PDF for example. This document could be hashed, then encrypted with your private key, to get . another takes the same document, hashes it, then decripts your signed document, checks the hash, if the hashes matches, then you really did 'sign' it by using your private key (only you could have done that).</p>\n<p>A transaction gets submitted to the network and is collected into a transaction pool.</p>\n<p>You can generate a public/private key with <code>openssl</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout | openssl ec -text -noout\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which generates this:</p>\n<pre><code>read EC key\nPrivate-Key: (256 bit)\npriv:\n    04:d9:b6:10:bd:4e:4f:b1:b4:4e:37:ef:01:fd:20:\n    ce:fc:98:4a:6d:cc:75:e2:80:5d:97:a5:dc:e3:9b:\n    21:fc\npub:\n    04:c0:d2:b4:eb:8b:bd:ac:d1:e0:b8:be:61:c0:30:\n    de:70:31:f9:f2:0b:3c:02:c7:25:2b:7f:a2:f9:2c:\n    5f:06:d7:6f:e4:84:6e:eb:e1:75:7e:b8:83:35:e0:\n    6a:95:cc:58:dc:22:d1:c9:97:4d:24:7c:b3:51:e1:\n    41:19:ff:b3:3d\nASN1 OID: secp256k1\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"blocks\">Blocks</h2>\n<p>A block consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A list transactions (included at the miners discretion)</li>\n<li>A reference to the previous block hash, a nonce (for proof of work)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first transaction in the list is called a coinbase, and consists of the miners address, any coin rewards plus the total mining fees from the transactions. The hash of all this information will become the link to the next block.</p>\n<p>All chains start somewhere. With Blockchain it is the Genesis block. Geneis means 'the origin or mode of formation of something'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mining\">Mining</h2>\n<p>Block creation is regulated by the network, one block every 10 minutes, and is achieved by using a mining difficulty. A SHA (Secure HAsh) algorithm is used. The attributes of a SHA algorithm are:</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt>Deterministic</dt>\n    <dd>any input always produces the same output</dd>\n    <dt>Verifiable</dt>\n    <dd>computing the hash of an input is efficient, O(1)</dd>\n    <dt>Uncorrelated</dt>\n    <dd>a tiny change in the input produces a vastly different hash</dd>\n    <dt>Irreversible</dt>\n    <dd>the original input cannot be recreated from the hash</dd>\n    <dt>Collision protection</dt>\n    <dd>should not be able to generate the same hash from two different inputs</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>A way to do this is to use a SHA hash, and state that the beginning of the hash must begin with an agreed (by the network) number of zeros. In our case we will go for one zero.</p>\n<p>Create a text file, <code>0.txt</code> for example and add this:</p>\n<pre><code>mark -&gt; bob 1000 1\nbob -&gt; alice 40 1\n\n8\n0\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lets check this block with:</p>\n<pre><code>shasum -a 256 0.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we get:</p>\n<pre><code>0b49856216b097e83eb8c9459638fbfa1ce02df7b6938b6903f4411aaa1bc72d  0.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>In our example protocol, lets assume the last line with text is the hash of the previous block (in this case it is a genesis block, so previous would be 0). Then, the line before that would be the nonce. The first hash would use 0 for the nonce. We would hash, if the hash begins with a zero, then we have mined a block. If not we need to increment the nonce, perform a hash, and rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>This is proof of work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-generate-a-bitcoin-address-step-by-step-9d7fcbf1ad0b\">How to generate a bitcoin address</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>Testing is essential to development. I've obviously used testing libraries such as Mocha, Chai, Ava, Tape, etc. But how would you go about writing one yourself? How would you build a test framework using that same framework to test itself? I got to thinking, just what would a test runner or 'test harness' consist of? I thought the basics would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It should be able to look for test file/s and execute tests within</li>\n<li>It should be able to make assertions within an executed test</li>\n<li>It should be able to report successes and failures of these assertions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So we would have a command line tool. We would run and record tests and their assertions and record results into a report that is delivered as the conclusion of the tests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"harness\">Harness</h2>\n<p>The term harness, or 'test framework', is the thing that keeps track of the tests and sends the result to the reporter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assertions\">Assertions</h2>\n<p>Assertions are statements of facts or beliefs. So they are binary; that an assertion is either correct or wrong. There are many styles of assertions, some prefer a string like method such as <code>expect(value).to.be.ok()</code> or simply <code>assert(condition)</code>.</p>\n<p>General assertions I included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'assert', 'ok', 'isOk': truthy</li>\n<li>'assertNot', 'not', 'notOk': falsy</li>\n<li>'throws', 'throw': expect an exception to be thrown</li>\n<li>'doesNotThrow', 'notThrow': will not throw an exception</li>\n<li>'equal', 'equals', 'isEqual', 'is', 'strictEqual', 'strictEquals', 'strictIs', 'isStrict', 'isStrictly': equality condition</li>\n<li>'deepEqual', 'deepEquals', 'isDeepEqual', 'isDeep', 'strictDeepEqual', 'strictDeepEquals': object/array equality condition</li>\n<li>'notEqual', 'inequal', 'notEqual', 'notEquals', 'notStrictEqual', 'notStrictEquals', 'isNotEqual', 'isNot', 'doesNotEqual', 'isInequal': object/array not equal</li>\n<li>'notNull', 'isNotNull': specific type assertion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Helper assertions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'isAbove', 'above', 'greaterThan', 'over': numeric value above</li>\n<li>'isBelow', 'below', 'lessThan': numeric value below</li>\n<li>'isAtLeast', 'atLeast', 'greaterThanOrEqual': numeric value less than or equal</li>\n<li>'isFalse': falsy value</li>\n<li>'isTrue': truthy value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Included on the assert function is an 'expect' function, so you can destructure and use like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">test('using expect' ({ expect }) =&gt; {\n  expect(true).to.be.ok();\n  expect(0).to.equal(0);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>'equal': equality test</li>\n<li>'ok': truthy test</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reporter\">Reporter</h2>\n<p>I decided to use <a href=\"https://testanything.org/tap-specification.html\">TAP (test anything protocol)</a> for the default reporter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This was a hugely beneficial exercise. Figuring out where to start was a challenge. I started with the assert statement as that is at the core of a test. All development was test driven too, so like Uncle Bob teaches - fail, pass, refactor.</p>\n<p>At times very challenging, but rewarding. There are lots of things I would do differently if I did it again though. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/testu/blob/master/README.md\">the repo here</a>.</p>\n"

Wow, what a definition. No wonder there is huge confusion in society. 'Reality'. Lets take money for example. People think there is nothing more 'real' than money. '<strong>Hard cash</strong>'. Money is a concept backed by an agreement. That is all it is. People die for political ideas; those ideas are more real to them than reality. The definition of 'reality' needs redefining.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atriangle\">A Triangle</h2>\n<p>The triangle in this case is more like a pyramid. At the bottom you have the majority, and at the top, you have the minority.</p>\n<p>Each hierarchical gradient above the previous has its own agenda, its own importances and their own reality. Looking from the bottom up, and from higher up, looking down, there are barriers. These barriers are things like attitude, awareness, and reality. For example, the 'mushroom syndrome'; kept in the dark and fed on shit. Take governments, banks, corporations et al, they have your private information, but can we see theirs? Each step above in the echelon has less and less visibility from below. From below we see more of an illusion. We think great stars or monarchy are god like. Well, sorry to disappoint, they are not. I'm not saying some personalities are not gifted, that is not true. Some are gifted, but all are human. Just because of where you are born does not mean you are 'genetically superior'. Yet that is the reality of some. Look at these Etonians. Deluded from birth and brainwashed throughout their lives, poor fellows.</p>\n<p>In a triangle, you have a boss. Or you are a boss. There is a divide between your echelon and the ones above and below. A 'trickle down' economy. A bullshit engine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acircle\">A Circle</h2>\n<p>King Arthur had a round table for a reason. All parties were equal. They were however aligned in a common goal; ethics and justice. Moreover they had morality, integrity, and honour. Each of them played the game together. Each of them had strengths. Each of them had weaknesses. Weaknesses that were compensated by the qualities of the other team mates. A cirgle is a team, with a common goal. A circle leads to expansion, and to be honest, something that gets relegated to being 'non-serious' - FUN! How much fun do you have at work? If you are not having any then there is something wrong!</p>\n<h2 id=\"future\">Future</h2>\n<p>If there is a future, and people can extract themselves from the indoctrination of the triangle life, then the circle will create a new world.</p>\n"

Result: client is still unsure what they want, the code has become a mish mash of fast iterations leaving the code base in need of refactoring anyway. No documentation. Reverse engineered design documents.</p>\n<p>Agile does not say NO DOCUMENTATION. Documentation is only as useful as it is useful hahaha. Get it? Is there ONE SENTENCE that could clear up a lot of confusion? Write the fucker down.</p>\n<p>Has shitty project management pretended to be Scrum and Agile just because they've read a Scrum Master book? They ask 'when will it be done?', 'are we fucking there yet?'. You estimate, but fuck the estimate, you better get these tasks done because we have a deadline. Fuck testing then!</p>\n<h2 id=\"uxresearchanddesign\">UX Research and Design</h2>\n<p>Did you conduct user research into exactly what your target audience needs? 'Oh no, we don't rate UX research'. Or 'oh, we'll get to that during usability testing.' Or maybe they won't do usability testing at all. Yeah isn't UX like new age political correctness wank? Well, no, it is probably the most important part of a project - SHOULD YOU DO THIS PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE and IS THIS ACTUALLY USEFUL and CAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THIS? Seriously underrated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"useyourhead\">Use Your Head</h2>\n<p>So many times a developer does something 'because the specification asked for it'. Yet, the actual spec was total nonsense. I've seen people deliberately add a typo because 'thats what the acceptance criteria said'. Seriously, can people not think for themselves? Do they really accept everything that life puts in front of them? They must have really sore arse holes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thepowerofsimplicity\">The Power of Simplicity</h2>\n<p>There's an anecdote of a truck too tall for a tunnel and getting stuck. Engineers come and are standing around figuring out the best way to cut part of the roof off so that the truck can be extracted. Then a little girl comes along and says 'why don't you let the tyres down?'. The problem is, you get given a problem which has with it a proposed solution. 'The truck's roof is too tall for the tunnel so part of it needs to be removed so that the truck can be removed'. Do not give the developer a solution; they are the ones who come up with the solution. And developers, think for yourselves please?</p>\n<h2 id=\"systemandcodedesign\">System and Code Design</h2>\n<p>Design has pretty much died out these days. Why waste time with 'pretty pictures' and old ideas when you can jump straight in and start coding! Look! We have some code! Look how complicated it is! I'm using all the latest libraries. Look, we are fully FP, we don't use Array.push because that is a side effect! All our objects are destructured (even though it is still passed by reference).</p>\n<p>I learned programming using Flow Schemas, JSP (Jackson Structured Programming), UML, and obviously flow charts. Beautiful and fun things.</p>\n<p>After 20 years I still can't comprehend why a group of people sit around talking about abstract ideas and struggle through confusion. I remember once doing an architecture diagram because the 20 or so servers, ports, DBs et al were just so annoying to keep in your head. A simple 'THAT THING THERE' (point to diagram). 20 hours of meandering and non-comprehension averted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technology\">Technology</h2>\n<p>I've made something cool, but 90% useless, 10% cool code. People jump on board with enthusiasm, either because of the person who wrote it, or the potential to be the first to like it.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of taking 3 steps to build a form 1. html, 2. add styles, and 3. add an endpoint to take the POST values, we install an entire framework, install a tonne of dependancies, some boilerplate shite, linters, parsers, transpilers, then componentise the shit out of the form, 21 files, couple of hundred lines of code, css in js, update the version of the framework as it has upgraded since you started writing this, the transpiler is not compatable with the new version of the framework so you revert, state management, type checking, build scripts, and a nice shiny turd. Oh, my tests fail.</p>\n<p>To be continued ...</p>\n"

I have just looked at the dictionary definitions of 'Capitalist' and 'Capitalism'. However, not all dictionaries are created equally. Before jumping in, we need to talk about money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"money\">Money</h2>\n<p>I've covered money before, but to reiterate, money is a concept backed by confidence. If you don't believe this then research examples such as <a href=\"https://forgottennewsmakers.com/2011/01/28/henry-christophe-1767-%E2%80%93-1820-king-of-haiti/\">Christophe, the King of Haiti</a> who overthrew the French and based the new currency on Gourdes (even now Haitian currency is called the Gourd).</p>\n<p>Money used to be tied to a physical asset such as gold. Nowadays money is printed by the governments or a private company who base it on bonds (which is just another form of printed paper) in a trail of complexity to make it hard to understand. So money is key to capitalism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"capitalism\">Capitalism</h2>\n<p>One definition of 'Capitalism' I came across is: 'an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state'. Ok. Just a lot of words to do with a system of government and trade yeah? Hmmm, not really. What this really means is that capitalists do not create anything. They use their money to make  more money, but don't actually do anything themselves. 'He who has the gold makes the rules' as they say. They basically live off people who do the actual  work. To me this looks like the actual system of government, not the 'democracy' we think.</p>\n<p>I read <a href=\"https://www.richdad.com/\">Robert Kiyosaki's 'Rich Dad Poor Dad'</a> a long time ago. A great book, but one part I resented was the fact he was promoting that you get people to work for you, you do nothing, but take most of the profit. Is this not paracitic? This is capitalism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"entrepreneurs\">Entrepreneurs</h2>\n<p>The entrepreneur, the creators/producers, the managers, all these people make products or perform services for an exchange. An entrepreneur undertakes something. They see a need, or have a passion, and work at producing it.</p>\n<p>You may say that most entrepreneurs wouldn't get off the ground if it wasn't for investors. Well possibly, but isn't that the sorry state we are in? The mindset of the average person is so indoctriniated in the system that they can't see outside the box. This is why I hate the phrase 'creating jobs'. You could pay one group of people to dig a hole one day, then another team to fill it in the day after, wouldn't that 'create jobs'? Yeah, it would be totally rediculous too. Today we have crowd funding. People want to be included and be part of something they themselves believe in. This is true democracy.</p>\n"

    "md": "<p>Artificial Intelligence is all the buzz lately. I remember Back at University I did a module on neural networks, quite a few labs, and was especially interested in Expert Systems. I remember at the time writing essays on AI, even getting down to Homunculus arguments. However, the year 2000 was not right for AI. Competitions were being won by complex <code>if then else</code> type brute force algorithms. It was a fascinating area of research though, and I saw huge possibilities. However, with all the latest progress, and hype, I still feel it has severe limitations.</p>\n<p>As usual with human communcation the devil is in the terms and their definitions. Lets go over some of these first:</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt>Knowledge</dt>\n    <dd>facts, information, and skills aquired through experience or education</dd>\n    <dt>Learning</dt>\n    <dd>the aquisition of knowledge or skills through study, eperience etc</dd>\n    <dt>Intelligence</dt>\n    <dd>The ability to aquire and apply knowledge and skills</dd>\n    <dt>Awareness</dt>\n    <dd>knowledge or perception of a situation or fact</dd>\n    <dt>Consciousness</dt>\n    <dd>The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>My initial gripe with AI was to do with consciousness. We do not know what human consciousness is. And we probably are a long way off understanding it. However, as per the <strong>definition</strong> of 'conscious' above, it evades any philosophical pondering. The definitions of 'awareness' and 'conscious' are sufficiently vague and seem to follow the 'scientific' thinking that everything is stimulous-response - that we are all bumbling aggregates of cells with no self determined thought; chemical reactions on legs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sensors\">Sensors</h2>\n<p>There are tonnes of electronic sensors, for example motion, gas, heat, distance, light, and so many other types. These devices, combined with software, provide a stimulus-response type of activity coordinated by an entity. With working products like self driving cars, airoplane autopilot, even home automation, we can say these machines are 'aware and respond to their surroundings'. As per the definitions above, here we really have artificial intelligence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"statistics\">Statistics</h2>\n<p>Neural networks are just statistical analysis. There. I said it. However, isn't that what a mind is anyway? (see how I used 'mind' and not 'brain'). What does the mind do? It observes, compares current scenarios to previous similar scenarios, provides possible decisions and poses possible outcomes in the future, with the sole purpose of keeping the organism alive and, possibly reproduction of itself.</p>\n<p>There is fuzzyness in all of the above. There is never, ever, a 100% correct answer. The mind would therefore look for the most positive effect (towards it's own survival) and least destructive to itself (destruction could be directed towards another entity, such as in killing an animal or foe).</p>\n<p>Could you replecate a mind like this, as described above artificially? Totally possible. But would it have any identity? I would say an emphatic <strong>no</strong>.</p>\n<p>Why no? Because of your individual identity. Some would ask 'is identity real?', or some would say that my idea of my own idea of identity is merely a delusion.  Well, my own sense of self is very real to me. Part of science is empirical, so my awareness of self is my scientific proof.</p>\n<h2 id=\"definitioncomparisons\">Definition comparisons</h2>\n<p>Looking up the definitions above left me with an uneasy feeling. I do remember looking at these definitions 20-30 years ago and the current definitions didn't quite match my previous understanding. I feel a 'dumbing down' is afoot, and judging by the aforementioned definitions of 'conscious' and 'awareness', these seem to me to be limitations in the English language.</p>\n<p>I thought I would go ahead and check these defintions again, this time with a very old dictionary, <a href=\"http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/conscious\">Websters 1828 American dictionary</a>.</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt>Knowledge</dt>\n    <dd>A clear and certain perception of that which exists, or of truth and fact; the perception of the connection and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of our ideas</dd>\n    <dt>Learning</dt>\n    <dd>The knowledge of principles or facts received by instruction or study</dd>\n    <dt>Intelligence</dt>\n    <dd>Understanding; skill</dd>\n    <dt>Consciousness</dt>\n    <dd>The knowledge of sensations and mental operations, or of what passes in ones own mind; the act of the mind which makes known an internal object. CONSCIOUSNESS of our sensation, and consciousness of our existence, seem to be simultaneous. CONSCIOUSNESS must be an essential attribute of spirit</dd>\n    <dt>Conscious</dt>\n    <dd>Possessing the faculty or power of knowing ones own thoughts or mental operations. Thus, man is a conscious being</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This is fascinating.</p>\n<p>Look at how they describe consciousness. You know who you are now, are aware of sensations, current mental operations, thinking thoughts, alert in the current time stream.</p>\n<p>What is really interesting is that the derivation of 'intelligent' is: early 16th century: from Latin intelligent- ‘understanding’, from the verb intelligere, variant of intellegere ‘understand’, from inter ‘between’ + legere ‘choose’. Get that, 'choose between'. The power of choice. Choice does not necessarily come from facts, data, education, or even random. There is personal choice, which is not neccessarily made from past experience or education. And also, one of the secondary definitions is 'A spiritual being; as a created intelligence. It is believed that the universe is peopled with innumerable superior intelligences'. This is from a dictionary from the early 19th century! Sounds more like science fiction from the 20th!</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As far as I can see, there has been serious dumbing down of 'intelligence'. To me 'science' has taken a huge step backwards. There seems to be a real pushback concerning anything 'outside the box'. The fact of the matter is we are lost. Big style. Clinging on to something 'real', or denying ones existance and justifying it by 'science has proven we are chemicals reacting' is just utter irresponsibility, and in my opinion, real delusion. For gods sake there is something that cannot be explained away by 'just chemical reactions', so please can someone do research into it? I even heard a developer once say that 'emotions are not logical'. Who says emotions are a subset of logic? Life is not a subset of logic either.</p>\n<p>'AI' can lead to some great things. I'm all for learning it. But don't dumb down life. If you think you are a collony of cells, I would suggest getting to know yourself, really getting to know yourself.</p>\n"

    "md": "<p>One of the first things I like to do after gaining some familiarity with a language is a couple of katas, maybe Blackjack, an API of some sort. All test driven of course. Thats what we'll do here. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/roppa/learning-rust\">my rust repo</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"definitions\">Definitions</h2>\n<p>Rust is a (system language)[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language</a>], meaning it can be used for low level stuff such as Operating Systems, hardware and the like. That doesn't mean it is limited to those however.</p>\n<p>Why Rust? Type safety, concurrency, blazingly fast.Rust has a steep learning curve however.</p>\n<h2 id=\"style\">Style</h2>\n<p>Rust has an opinionated coding style:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>indentations are 4 spaces</li>\n<li>variable names are snake case</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, before fundamentals, lets talk about the build runner, documentation generator, test runner and package manager - Cargo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cargo\">Cargo</h2>\n<p>Assuming you have installed Rust, go ahead and run this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cargo new hello\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a folder:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">└── hello\n    ├── Cargo.toml\n    └── src\n        └── main.rs\n</code></pre>\n<p>Cargo.toml:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[package]\nname = &quot;hello&quot;\nversion = &quot;0.1.0&quot;\nauthors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@your-email.com&gt;&quot;]\nedition = &quot;2018&quot;\n\n# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html\n\n[dependencies]\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the rust file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>First things first, the Cargo.toml file. This is the configuration file for your software. This has all the information about your project, the name, authors, version (semver) etc. It is also where you add your dependencies.</p>\n<p>The rust file that is generated is a 'hello world' by default.</p>\n<p>Now you can create an executable by running <code>cargo build</code>. Then execute by running <code>cargo run</code> (<code>cargo run</code> by itself builds and then runs).</p>\n<p>After you run <code>build</code> you will see a 'target' folder is created. in the target folder is 'debug', so you probably want to add this to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"main\">Main</h2>\n<p>The genesis of your project is the <code>main</code> function. This is what is executed when you run.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Functions are delcaried with a <code>fn</code> then name, parenthesis, then the body is in braces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"types\">Types</h2>\n<p>Integers are signed or unsigned: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 (usize and isize). i32 or u32 etc.</p>\n<p>You can use binary: 0b, octal: 0o, hex: 0x.</p>\n<p>Floats are f32 and f64. This is valid: 0.1, this is not: .1.</p>\n<p>Bool is <code>bool</code>, which are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>\n<p>A char is 4 bytes, a scalar, differing from a character within a string, which is utf-8 2 bytes.</p>\n<p>Tuple stores multiple values, accessed by dot syntax (maximum of 12):</p>\n<pre><code>let a = (1, 2, 3);\nprintln!(&quot;{}, {}, {}&quot;, a.0, a.1, a.2);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Arrays are limited to 32 length. Vectors are preferred over Arrays.</p>\n<h2 id=\"variables\">Variables</h2>\n<p>Variables are immutable in Rust, however, you can mutate them. Variables are declared using <code>let</code>. So Rust is strongly typed, but if it can deduce what the variable is, it will automatically create that type for you.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let [mut] [variable-name][: type] = [value];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just so we can see something, Rust uses the format <code>println!</code> to write to the console, more on this later, but notice the exclamation mark before the parenthesis. Also, when you see a <code>{}</code> that means it will be replaced by the params you pass after the string.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let a = 34;\nprintln!(&quot;Rust can deduce what type you want: {}&quot;, a);\n\nlet a:u32 = 34;\nprintln!(&quot;Or, you could add the unsigned integer 32 bit `:u32` type {}&quot;, a);\n\nlet mut change = 34;\nchange += 1;\nprintln!(&quot;This value is mutable, therefore changed {}&quot;, change);\n\nlet string = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;\nprintln!(&quot;{}&quot;, string);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We'll come back to strings.</p>\n<p><code>const</code> always uses SCREAMING snake case, and you MUST specify type. Consts are really fast to access. You can use them 'globally' i.e. outside functions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">const UNCHANGING:u32 = 123;\nprintln!(&quot;Const value is {}&quot;, UNCHANGING);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can destructure values and assign like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let (var1, var2) = (1, 2);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"helpfromthecompiler\">Help from the Compiler</h2>\n<p>When you get compile errors, Rust gives you a handy explain command: <code>rustc --explain E0384</code>. Run that to get more information on the error. Pretty useful stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blocksandscope\">Blocks and Scope</h2>\n<p>Scope in Rust is block level. It does have access to parent scope (nested blocks). A block can be created with braces <code>{}</code>, as in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    {\n        let x = 1;\n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Variables can also be 'shadowed', so you can declare the same variable name multiple times.</p>\n<h2 id=\"functions\">Functions</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn [snake_case function name]([param :type]) -&gt; [return type]\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn volume(x: i32, y: i32, z: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    return x * y * z;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the returned value, if you leave off the trailing semicolon of an expression, that value gets returned. (remember, an expression is anything that results in a value).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn volume(x: i32, y: i32, z: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    x * y * z\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: you know the <code>println!</code>, see the exclamation mark? That is a 'macro'. A macro is a type of function (more later). You can use macros when you do not have a fixed arity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"loops\">Loops</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/book/loops.html\">Rust loops</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"libraries\">Libraries</h2>\n<h2 id=\"tests\">Tests</h2>\n<p>Like all good languages, testing is built in to Rust.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crates\">Crates</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://crates.io/\">Crates</a> coming soon</p>\n<h2 id=\"ownershipandreferences\">Ownership and References</h2>\n<p>Coming soon</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://actix.rs\">Actix api framework</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CleanCut/rust_programming/\">CleanCut Rust corse</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>So I went ahead and created my first <a href=\"https://bit.ly/32QttAL\">Udemy course on Test Driven Development using Javascript and Jest</a>. I really enjoyed it. I created the Game of Life (<a href=\"https://digioli.co.uk/game-of-life/\">see the working example</a>). The course was more like a prototype, or experiment for me - how to create a course. I learned a lot from it; it certainly wasn't 'easy'.</p>\n<p>First step is deciding to do a course. Sounds simple? You have to give your intended product a name. You have to put it there, in the future. I have tonnes of ideas and a lot of expertise, but I like TDD and could do 1-2 hours on it. So that was my product. A test driven development course.</p>\n<p>Next is breaking the course up into small achievable steps. A huge bugbear of mine is importance. Any subject is broken into a hierarchy of importances. There are usually only a few essential concepts in a subject. These concepts are usually related. More, less essential, concepts are related to the core concepts, and less important - more 'edge' or 'expert' - concepts exist, but chances of experiencing them day-to-day are pretty slim. Therefore, cover the essentials first, cover their interrelation, then any sub or related concepts, then more detailed concepts as and when. Not every concept is equal to all other concepts.</p>\n<p>Another thing is to only teach one thing at a time.</p>\n<p>Once you have decided on the course, created a syllabus, next it is establishing the area to do the recording. This was a problem. I live in London, but a relatively quiet area. Still, the odd car passing etc made it an unpredictable space. I decided to set up in the spare room at the back of the house. My entire setup is in the living room, so I needed to create a 'mobile' workspace. I needed to order a small desk. I got <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PbU9ZM\">folding desk</a> from Amazon for around £33. To get decent sound Udemy suggest getting an external microphone, I went for the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WggDdx\">Blue Yeti</a>, great quality and look and feel are excellent. I also got a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2oe5NYW\">small sound shield</a> and a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MJE388\">stand</a>.</p>\n<p>Next step was to record a test video. If you haven't done a course before, Udemy ask for a sample video to be uploaded so that it meets their quality standards.</p>\n<p>I use Ubuntu on a Huawei laptop (great kit). I used Vokoscreen screen capture. A big learning curve was the type of video codec (and audio) to use. My plan was to record on Linux, then use Final Cut Pro which I have on my IMac. This was problemsome to begin with. I had to use trial and error to get the right cross compatable video and audio codec.</p>\n<p>Now I had the plan for the course, the kit, the software. Now it is doing it! A hard part was building up to starting. The solution was to just be myself and do it! Just like life, just be yourself. I made a LOT of mistakes, flubs etc. Thing is to not worry about it. You can undo, start again, and edit that bit out.</p>\n<p>Videos were done. The next thing, which I find missing in life, is comradery. A single viewpoint is not ideal. So getting people to review and code review is essential. Also learning to take suggestions and critiques is a big thing. At the end of the day, this is QA, this is how you develop great products: continuous feedback. A couple of friends did this for me, and the feedback was quality.</p>\n<p>Once you are happy you have to submit your course to Udemy. I did this and waited, and waited. Then a week later I realised my course had been published 5 days earlier! I didn't get any notifications.</p>\n<p>All in all, this has been a great exercise for me to do. So in summary, here is the course creation algorithm:</p>\n<h2 id=\"coursecreationalgorithm\">Course creation algorithm</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide you will create a course</li>\n<li>Decided the subject of the course</li>\n<li>List essential concepts</li>\n<li>List less important concepts</li>\n<li>Organise a syllabus based on 3 and 4</li>\n<li>Establish a quiet place to record</li>\n<li>Procure equipment (hardware and software)</li>\n<li>Record, commit code</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>tell them what you are going to teach them</li>\n<li>teach them</li>\n<li>tell them what you taught them</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Share and get feedback</li>\n<li>Redo 8 or create new videos, or update code, or both</li>\n<li>Publish</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whatwouldidodifferently\">What would I do differently?</h2>\n<p>One thing I forgot to do is implement this concept in teaching:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>tell them what you are going to teach them</li>\n<li>teach them</li>\n<li>tell them what you taught them</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also need to make the videos more slick. Some videos ended abruptly. I should have frozen the last frame and faded out.</p>\n<p>I'm a visual person, so one thing I felt totally lacking is diagrams. I'm looking into using Blender for this (quite a learning curve).</p>\n<p>Next time I'll record an intro video too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback</h2>\n<p>One thing I find lacking on Udemy is course feedback. The star ratings vary widely, my lowest 2 stars to highest 5 (out of 5). Currently 4.04 overall at the moment. People do not leave feedback on how to improve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/instructor/courses/\">Udemy instructor courses</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "md": "<p>Agile and other means were created to solve the problem of 'how to deliver a project', and create a product or service. From the sheer number of these systems extant we can probably guess that nobody knows how to consistently build a product or service without failure.</p>\n<p>There are a shit-tonne of ways a project can fail. Sabotage, incompetence, bad ideas, etc etc. So how can one live a happy life and get shit done? Probably these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you need to know where you are</li>\n<li>you need to have an idea how things are when they are going well</li>\n<li>you need to state the actual purpose why you are doing what you are doing</li>\n<li>you need to do what your purpose is</li>\n<li>you need to be aware when you drift from that purpose</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a developer I've experienced 'you need to work 40 hours a week', 'you need to log your hours done on a task in Jira' etc etc. Pretty much bullshit if you ask me. So what if someone clocks in and does 40 hours? What is the actual metric of a software engineer? I remember being in a meeting chaired by the business. They wanted a way to measure progress. They went round asking how many lines of code a developer wrote. 1000 the lead said, 600 said the senior, 150 said me. The business realised that was a stupid idea as they knew I had built a sleek system that solved some of the businesses problems.</p>\n<p>How can you monitor productivity? Why would you? Well, if you are doing any activity you should be striving for as close to perfection as possible. Don't piss your pants or have a knee jerk reaction to 'perfection'. I don't mean perfect per se; I mean the best of what is possible. Why do an activity if it is pointless? Might as well work for the government. Joking aside, this leads to the question 'what is the ideal'? As a developer you want to work smart, deliver what is needed and wanted, on time, have high morale and not be stressed by the whole thing. Ok, lets spell this out. The ideal scene for a developer is:</p>\n<p><strong>TO DELIVER THE EXACT, QUALITY SOFTWARE SOLUTION TO A GIVEN PROBLEM, ON TIME, WHILST BEING IN HIGH MORALE AND STRESS FREE</strong></p>\n<p>As an aside, one thing that leaps out at me from the above is how many times in the past I have done some work that has turned out to be a completely pointless activity. This is a red flag and indicates that the product owner does not have a clear idea of what needs to be built. It is a cop out to say 'in agile you respond to change'. What this actually means is you adjust priorities in order to get to your destination. Analogy here: you are sailing across the atlantic, your destination is New York leaving from Porstmouth, you set a compas direction, you monitor and steer to keep on track. What you don't do is set a course for New York, then Iceland, then Canary Islands. Another thing to be aware of with product owners is Daddies money. Are they really spending their own hard earned cash or spending on whim? This reflects badly on vision and results in a drop in morale of the developers.</p>\n<p>So how could we quantify morale and actual productivity? When we use Scrum we estimate tasks. This estimation changes over time as we get more and more precise the closer the team get and with more experience. So if each developer completes 15 points per week, consistently, we consider that a 'normal' situation. However, how is the developers morale? How are the quality assessments? What is their stress level? These other points are indicative that the scene is either working or something is missing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>points per day</li>\n<li>morale</li>\n<li>ratings from code reviews (maybe ratings such as bad, mediocre, good, very good, excellent, from colleagues)</li>\n<li>stress level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if points per day are low, it indicates blockers, or unclear task definition.</p>\n<p>Morale indicates whether the activity is needed and wanted and aligns with the general purpose.</p>\n<p>Code review ratings shows how much attention the developer is taking to what they are doing. Is it clean and easy to understand? Is it efficient? Is it correct? etc.</p>\n<p>How is their stress level? If it is high it indicates some friction somewhere.</p>\n<p>One does not need to get bogged down in needless admin. If that happens then morale will go down. Instead I like to think of this as a communicative task.</p>\n<p>Product owners should have no excuse for any negative situations or pointless activities.</p>\n"

    "md": "<p>Why do I struggle with GoLang? I mean it should be simple right? Yet coding in it didn't quite fit my mental framing. I struggled with understanding this then I realised - I like beautiful code.</p>\n<p>I've been doing js for a long time now. I got into functional programming, 'declarative' paradigms etc. The code became graceful. Beautiful. It became a pleasure to read it. With Go the syntax, at least for me, seems to come from the Brutalism movement. Some duplication of code is considered OK, like anonymous structs etc. Maps and structs, lots of <code>if err != nil</code> noise, no <code>.map</code> or <code>.reduce</code> but instead lots of <code>for</code> loops.</p>\n<p>The huge functions - scores of lines long are all too common. I like to think a function does one thing and one thing well. Then these functions can be aggregated into a parent function, so the code becomes easy to read. Uncle Bob and Grady Booch said that code should read like well written prose. I totally agree with this. Maybe the next step is code should read like poetry?</p>\n"

If there is a subset, it has no way to see outside of itself, the superset knows what it contains. Therefore the subset cannot name what is outside of it, that name would exist within itself.</p>\n<pre><code>Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery\nBy having desire, you can only see what is visibly real\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to have desire, you have a whole lot of appendages. First, you have to assume a particular beingness. You have taken a step down from freedom in order to play a game. A game consists of beingness, goal, barriers, opponents, winning, losing etc. In order to drop down from enlightenment one has to assume a mystery then, otherwise you would not be interested in desire. So therefore, dropping down from knowing, to looking, especially after assuming a beingness, you see a filtered sense of reality.</p>\n<pre><code>Yet mystery and reality emerge from the same source\nThis source is called darkness\n\nDarkness born from darkness\nThe beginning of all understanding\n</code></pre>\n<p>To have a mystery, you also need a reality. In order to drop down into these, it must come from a source. I see it as crossing some sort of boundary, an entering into a universe. That boundary must be the darkness. Outside is enlightenment, inside is mystery.</p>\n<p>Darkness born from darkness must mean ones awareness being aware that one is, but one is in a state of mystery. Darkness being abstract, but not abstract for ones awareness of not knowing. If one is aware of being aware, really, they are on a path beginning understanding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter2\">Chapter 2</h2>\n<pre><code>When people see things as beautiful ugliness is created\nWhen people see things as good, evil is created\n\nBeing and non-being produce each other\nDifficult and easy complement each other\nLong and short define each other\nHigh and low oppose each other\nFore and aft follow each other\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think the best way to understand this is to do a little drill. With you mind silent, create in front of you a eight corners of a rectangle. Inside create 2 balls at either side, one blue, extremely cold, and one red, extremely hot. Here you have dichotomies - hot and cold. Also notice that they are being kept apart by you, so to have a dichotamy you have to have a way to keep them seperate. This is quite subtle. When you have a scale, if you are bias towards one, you knowingly, or unknowingly create the other. 'I want to be pious' for example. From this the world would turn into a place full of temptation, and your life would become a struggle to keep on the straight line.</p>\n<pre><code>Therefore the Master can act without doing anything and teach without saying a word.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think this is a subtle one. In order to do, in a dichotomic state, one has to 'be' first. For example, to bake a cake one takes on the beingness of a baker. Be-do-have. Have your cake and eat it. However, the Master can still act. Being present with ingredients for a cake, the art of creation, they can still bake a cake. 'All the gear and no idea' rings true.</p>\n<pre><code>Things come her way and she does not stop them;\nthings leave and she lets them go.\nShe has without possessing, and acts without any expectations.\nWhen her work is done, she takes no credit.\nThat is why it will last forever.\n</code></pre>\n"
